Many of the research projects we undertake benefit from pooling the skills of scientists and engineers with diverse backgrounds. We gain from close interaction with staff from almost all faculties of the NUS, the National Research Centres and Research Institutes. Building active international links strengthens the development of TMSI's research programmes. This multi-skill team approach has proven successful in giving research at the TMSI a flying start. For this and other reasons, the TMSI is the first of a new model for research institutes in Singapore. Webmaster Login Â© Copyright 2001-2009 National University of Singapore. All Rights Reserved.
