In recent months, NEX is being re-organized and absorbed into another division, NUS Enterprise. In line with our efforts to consolidate our programme offerings so as to align with the overall strategic direction of the University, it is deemed that much of the work of NUS Extension can now be subsumed to other NUS institutes and faculties. In connection with this, NEX will be discontinuing our open-registration and corporate customized portfolios. We thank customers for the past support for our Extension programmes and seminars.
