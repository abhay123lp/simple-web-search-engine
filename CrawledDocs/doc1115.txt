This is according to the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) computer-based assessment of Problem Solving, organised by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</p><p>According to the 2012 PISA findings, our students are innovative, are able to handle uncertainty, and dare to experiment with alternative solutions. These highly valued competencies stand them in good stead in a globalised, information-rich economy increasingly dominated by highly skilled, non-routine jobs, and give them the wherewithal to come together to create a brighter future for our society.</p><p>The strong performance of our students reflects our curricular emphasis and our schools&#8217; efforts in developing problem solving skills in our students.</p><p>Our broad and inclusive education system has also allowed us to bring out the best in every child. The results of PISA 2012 show that Singapore has one of the deepest and widest talent pools of students who have the ability to apply thinking skills effectively to solve problems. Even our proportion of weaker or low performers in Problem Solving is among the lowest of all participating education systems. </p><p>Mr Andreas Schleicher, Special Advisor to the Secretary-General on Education Policy and Deputy Director for Education and Skills of OECD was in Singapore to launch the PISA 2012 results on Problem Solving, and he said, <em>&#8220;Singapore&#8217;s education system has at times been criticised for encouraging rote learning at the expense of developing creative skills. The PISA 2012 assessment of problem solving skills proves those critics wrong. It shows that today&#8217;s 15-year-olds in Singapore are quick learners, highly inquisitive, able to solve unstructured problems in unfamiliar contexts, and highly skilled in generating new insights by observing, exploring and interacting with complex situations. Indeed, no education system outperforms Singapore on this test.&#8221;</em></p><p>Reflecting on the strong performance of our students in PISA, Ms Ho Peng, Director-General of Education said, <em>&#8220;We are pleased with the strong performance by our students in PISA 2012. This affirms our efforts in giving our students not just a strong foundation in literacy and numeracy, but also in equipping them with the skills to solve problems in real-world contexts. Over time, our teaching strategies have focused on helping students gain a deeper conceptual understanding and developing their thinking skills. Our students can navigate well in unfamiliar contexts because of the many opportunities to learn not just within the classroom, but also beyond the classroom through co-curricular activities and service projects. We will continue to look for ways to help our students grow to become compassionate and confident citizens, contributing not only to Singapore but also to the world.&#8221;</em></p><h4>Key Findings</h4><h5>Singapore Students Possessing Traits for Effective Problem Solving</h5><p>Of the 44 participating education systems, Singapore students are joint-first with Korea students (see <a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/Table-1-Mean-Scores-in-PISA-2012-CBA-of-Problem-Solving.pdf">Table 1 in Annex</a>).</p><p>Singapore students have performed well in problem solving processes which involve:</p><ul><li>Exploring and understanding the situation around a problem, </li><li>Representing and formulating hypotheses about the factors involved in the problem and their relationships with each other, </li><li>Planning and executing the steps in a devised plan, and </li><li>Monitoring and reflecting on the progress of the plan and the eventual solution of the problem. </li></ul><p>PISA study shows that our students perform very well in both the knowledge acquisition processes (exploring and understanding, representing and formulating) and the knowledge utilisation processes (planning and executing), but with an edge in knowledge acquisition (see <a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/Table-2-Performance-by-Problem-Solving-Processes-and-Nature-of-Problem.pdf">Table 2</a> and <a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/Figure-1-Joint-Analysis-of-Strength-and%20Weaknesses.pdf">Figure 1 in Annex</a>).</p><p>According to PISA, our students are quick learners, highly inquisitive, and able to experiment with alternatives and process abstract information. They are able to use the knowledge they have to solve the problems, and are goal-driven and persistent in completing their tasks. </p><p>PISA also measured students&#8217; relative strengths at handling different types of problems, namely: </p><ul><li>Interactive tasks where one must explore and uncover the relevant information in the process of solving the problem, and </li><li>Static tasks where all relevant information is provided up front. </li></ul><p>While Singapore students perform very well in both types of tasks, they have an edge in interactive over static tasks, as compared to OECD countries on average (see <a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/Table-2-Performance-by-Problem-Solving-Processes-and-Nature-of-Problem.pdf">Table 2</a> and <a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/Figure-1-Joint-Analysis-of-Strength-and%20Weaknesses.pdf">Figure 1 in Annex</a>). They are able to: </p><ul><li>Devise and initiate concrete actions, </li><li>Gather feedback on the effect of their interventions, and </li><li>Sift out what is relevant to solving the problem.</li></ul><p>This suggests that our teachers have been encouraging our students to be curious, innovative and to use their intuition to solve problems.</p><h5>Deep and Wide Talent Pool</h5><p>Singapore has the highest proportion of students who are top performers<sup><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote1-anchor">1</a></sup> in Problem Solving - almost 3 in 10 students, close to three times that of the OECD average. Not only are these effective problem-solvers who can systematically explore complex problems, understand how relevant information is structured, carry out multi-step solutions and carefully monitor their progress towards solving the problems, they are also able to develop an overall strategic plan based on a complete and coherent mental model of the problem.</p><p>Among all the participating education systems, Singapore has the deepest talent pool of 25 per cent, i.e. students with strong mastery of a specific knowledge domain and the ability to apply their skills flexibly in other contexts. </p><p>Singapore also has the second widest talent pool of 46 per cent, i.e. students who are highly proficient in at least one of the four domains<sup><a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote2-anchor">2</a></sup> in PISA. </p><h5>Small Proportion of Low Performers in Problem Solving</h5><p>The proportion of Singapore students who are low performers<sup><a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote3-anchor">3</a></sup> in Problem Solving, at 8 per cent, is a third of the OECD average. It is among the lowest of all the participating education systems. Nevertheless, MOE and our schools will continue to look for even more effective methods to support the learning needs of our low-performing students. </p><h4>Background</h4><p>PISA is a triennial international benchmarking study organised by OECD that examines and compares how well education systems are helping their students acquire the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies. It assesses the capacity of 15-year-old students to apply knowledge and skills in Mathematics, Reading and Science, and to analyse, reason and communicate effectively as they solve problems in a variety of real-life situations. Singapore participated in six assessments in PISA 2012 - the paper-based assessments of Reading, Mathematics and Science, and the computer-based assessments of Reading, Mathematics and Problem Solving. Findings on the first five assessments were released on 3 Dec 2013. </p><p>This is the second time that Singapore has participated in PISA. A total of 5,369 students, mainly from Secondary 3 and 4, from all 166 public secondary schools participated in PISA 2012. One hundred and seventy-seven students from six private schools also participated in the study. The sampling methods applied by OECD in PISA ensure that the students selected were representative of the 15-year-old population in Singapore. </p><h4>Footnote</h4><ol class="footnote"><li id="footnote-1">PISA defines top performers as those whose proficiency level is at least Level 5 out of a scale of 6.<a href="#footnote1-anchor">&crarr;</a></li><li id="footnote-2">The four domains PISA refers to are Problem Solving and the paper-based assessments of Mathematics, Reading and Science.<a href="#footnote2-anchor">&crarr;</a></li><li id="footnote-3">PISA defines low performers as those whose proficiency level is below Level 2 (a baseline level of proficiency that allows students to participate effectively and productively in life).<a href="#footnote3-anchor">&crarr;</a></li></ol> http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/singapore-education/media/~3/dSufkUu6Dyw/singapore-students-excel-in-thinking-flexibility.php http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/2014/04/singapore-students-excel-in-thinking-flexibility.php Tue, 01 Apr 2014 17:10:00 +0800 http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/2014/04/singapore-students-excel-in-thinking-flexibility.php Information Sheet on 21st Century Competencies <p>Globalisation, changing demographics and technological advancements are some of the key driving forces of the future. Our students will have to be prepared to face these challenges and seize the opportunities brought about by these forces.</p><p>To help our students thrive in a fast-changing world, the Ministry of Education, Singapore (MOE) has identified competencies that have become increasingly important in the 21st Century. These competencies, represented in the following framework, underpin the holistic education that our schools provide to better prepare our students for the future economy and society. </p><p>At the same time, home and the family are also important contexts for the student&#8217;s development in these competencies. Schools and parents need to work hand-in-hand to help our students develop 21st Century Competencies.</p><h4>Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes<br><img alt="framework-for-21st-century-competencies-and-student-outcomes.png" src="http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/images/2014/03/21cc-framework.png" style="width:500px; border:none" /></h4><h4>21st Century Competencies</h4><p>Knowledge and skills must be underpinned by values. Values define a person&#8217;s character. They shape the beliefs, attitudes and actions of a person, and therefore form the core of the framework of 21st Century Competencies.</p><p>The middle ring signifies the Social and Emotional Competencies - skills necessary for children to recognise and manage their emotions, develop care and concern for others, make responsible decisions, establish positive relationships, as well as handle challenging situations effectively.</p><p>The outer ring of the framework represents the emerging 21st Century Competencies necessary for the globalised world we live in. These are: * Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills;* Critical and Inventive Thinking;* Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills</p><p>Together, these competencies will enable our young to capitalise on the rich opportunities of the new digital age, while keeping a strong Singapore heartbeat. The aim is develop in every Singaporean child, a confident person, a self-directed learner, a concerned citizen, and an active contributor.</p><h4>Bringing Out the Best in Every Child</h4><p>The teaching of 21st Century Competencies occurs across the entire school experience and not just in the classroom. </p><h4>Infused in Total Curriculum</h4><p><em>Academic Curriculum</em></p><p>The 21st Century Competencies are explicitly infused into the teaching and learning in all subject areas. For instance, in Science, teachers use inquiry-based approaches that provide students with opportunities to engage with a problem, collect and make meaning of evidence, reason, conduct investigations and make inferences or decisions. In Social Studies, we reinforce the inquiry mindset, requiring students to examine evidence to support different points of view. </p><p><em>Co-curricular Activities</em></p><p>Schools offer a wide range of co-curricular activities (CCAs) in the arts, sports, uniformed groups, etc. to provide our students with a diversity of authentic learning experiences and more importantly, the opportunity to work in teams. Students often initiate, plan, and execute events or activities together, and then reflect upon whether they have achieved what they set out to do. This allows our students to learn to deal with less structured and more open-ended situations beyond what they would learn in a classroom. It gives them the opportunity to explore new areas, uncover new knowledge and skills, and try their hand at new activities. Through CCAs, they are able to go beyond the school to interact with the community around their school, further afield in Singapore or even overseas. </p><p><em>Character and Citizenship Education</em></p><p>In addition, schools have in place Values-in-Action (VIA) and Learning for Life Programmes (LLP) which support students&#8217; development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to society. These programmes also help students learn and apply values, knowledge and skills, and foster their ownership in contributing to the community. For instance, as part of VIA, students reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully. Many of the objectives of our character and citizenship education curriculum are achieved through explicit classroom teaching, infusion into the academic curriculum and leveraging teachable moments in CCAs.</p><p><em>Applied Learning Programmes</em></p><p>Complementing the core academic and student development programmes are the Applied Learning programmes (ALP) to help students develop thinking skills, connect knowledge across subject disciplines, stretch their imagination, and apply these in authentic settings. These programmes also aim to help students appreciate the relevance and value of what they are learning in the academic curriculum, and develop stronger motivation and purpose to acquire knowledge and skills.</p><h5>Capable, Empowered Teachers</h5><p>Our teachers are equipped with the necessary skills and resources to empower them to develop 21st Century Competencies in students. All our teachers now receive pre-service training from the National Institute of Education (NIE) based on the Teacher Education 21 (TE21) framework (introduced in 2009) with a strong focus on developing the competencies to teach 21st Century Competencies. On-going in-service training and professional development programmes are also available for teachers through the Academy of Singapore Teachers and specialised teacher academies, so that our teachers may sustain their learning and keep abreast of the latest in teaching and learning strategies.</p><h5>Innovative Teaching Methods to Develop Depth and Breadth of Thinking</h5><p>Across disciplines and activities, teachers make use of a variety of strategies to help students structure their thinking process. Some examples include the use of concept maps to help students construct the interconnections between different concepts, and thinking routines such as Think-Puzzle-Explore, where students take stock of their prior knowledge, identify puzzling questions or areas of interest to pursue and seek to find out more about the topic. Students also work collaboratively on various tasks and projects which support their development of thinking skills. There is increasingly greater effort to make learning authentic and relevant by situating learning in real-world contexts - through field-trips, hands-on lab and workshop studies. In the past five years, there has been a more pervasive use of information-communication tools to promote self-directed and collaborative learning among students.</p><h5>Partnerships with Community</h5><p>Schools work closely with the industry, Institutes of Higher Learning and the community to create many hands-on, authentic learning environments for their students to ensure they develop skills aligned to industry demand and future needs. They also guide students on the career options and possibilities available. Through our partnership with the community, we also enrich the diversity and depth of our CCAs, VIA programmes, LLPs and ALPs. </p> http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/singapore-education/media/~3/7c0-Cmnw5iI/information-sheet-on-21st-century.php http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/2014/04/information-sheet-on-21st-century.php Tue, 01 Apr 2014 17:10:00 +0800 http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/2014/04/information-sheet-on-21st-century.php Senior Minister of State Indranee Rajah to Lead Second Study Trip for Applied Study in Polytechnics and ITE Review (ASPIRE) and Attend International Summit on the Teaching Profession <p>Ms Indranee Rajah, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Law and Ministry of Education, will lead a delegation to study the technical and vocational education systems in New Zealand and Australia from 30 March to 4 April 2014.

I am happy to be present today for the official launch of the 24th Project CABIN. &#8220;Chillbox&#8221;, as it is called, is a joint partnership between Singapore Children&#8217;s Society and Siglap Secondary School, and, I note that its launch coincides with the 20th Anniversary of Project CABIN.</p><p>Project CABIN has indeed come a long way since it was first set up 20 years ago, in 1994. During its formative years, Project CABIN was meant to be a place for young people to hang out at. It sought to address the issues of premature school leaving and delinquency among youths. Since then, the project has evolved into a learning hub for building character, imparting values and learning social skills. The Chillbox@Siglap is one good example. For the students of Siglap Secondary, Chillbox@Siglap is a place where they take part in meaningful after-school activities, such as workshops, talks and group work. I learned that the name &#8220;Chillbox&#8221; was chosen by the students. The name was picked out through a school-wide competition and I am glad that the students were given the opportunity to have a say in the setting up of their own Project CABIN.</p><p>Chillbox@Siglap is a good example of a programme that complements what our schools do. The activities that students participate in Chillbox@Siglap provide them with learning opportunities beyond the classroom. Students learn dance moves by participating in a Hip Hop Workshop and learn how to play African Drums in another. They also advocate anti-bullying through the Bully-Free Campaign and undergo Peer Befriending Training to learn how to provide peer support to their schoolmates. Being engaged in such activities helps the students learn new skills and gain confidence in their leadership abilities, which is all part of providing students with a holistic education.</p><p>I am encouraged by the partnerships our schools forge with community partners such as the Singapore Children&#8217;s Society and with parents to meet our students&#8217; educational needs. I understand that the teachers in charge of Chillbox@Siglap work closely with youth workers to plan suitable activities for the students. For instance, to ensure that the activities planned for the students cater for their needs and interests, the teachers conducted surveys and sourced for activities that encompassed sports, music and the arts. </p><p>Project CABIN also provides students with the opportunity to reach out to members of the larger community and learn to be active citizens. For example, in 2013, CABIN Club members from 8 schools, including Siglap Secondary, participated in an Inter-CABIN competition named &#8220;Project IMPACT&#8221;. This Values-In-Action project provided students with an opportunity to be involved in service learning. I learn that 5 Siglap Secondary students worked on a project to raise public awareness about animal abuse and to promote kindness and appreciation of animals. The students enjoyed the experience so much that one of the students involved in the project, a Secondary 2 student, Poh Hana Lee, has since signed up as a regular volunteer in order to continue giving back to society.</p><p>It is heart-warming to hear our young people learn to care for others and becoming committed to larger causes. I commend the Singapore Children&#8217;s Society for keeping up with the latest trends among youths and consistently creating new and engaging programmes to meet their needs. I am pleased to note that the CABIN fanpage and CABIN Alumni Club, that was started in 2012, continue to engage youths online and provide graduating members of the CABIN Club with a platform to stay connected with one another.</p><p>I am encouraged to learn that the CABIN Alumni Club committee, set up last October, explores and organises volunteering opportunities for the 70-member strong Alumni Club to contribute to the wider community. Graduates of the CABIN Clubs from various schools have volunteered in camps as well as helped and guided Junior CABIN members in running CABIN events. This speaks well of our young people&#8217;s passion and commitment and I hope that they inspire their peers and younger students to be involved in service learning projects. </p><p>I congratulate Singapore Children&#8217;s Society and Siglap Secondary School for undertaking this joint venture. With your concern for our students, and your commitment to their well-being, I am confident that you will ensure that Project CABIN&#8217;s excellent work will continue. I also wish the Siglap Project CABIN, &#8220;Chillbox&#8221;, the very best.</p><p>Thank you.</p> http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/singapore-education/media/~3/9rARkpkglcI/speech-by-ms-sim-ann-at-the-official-launch-of-24th-project-cabin.php http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/speeches/2014/03/15/speech-by-ms-sim-ann-at-the-official-launch-of-24th-project-cabin.php Sat, 15 Mar 2014 13:00:00 +0800 http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/speeches/2014/03/15/speech-by-ms-sim-ann-at-the-official-launch-of-24th-project-cabin.php Registration of Instructors Offering Co-Curricular and Enrichment Activities to Schools <p>Instructors offering co-curricular and enrichment activities to schools will be required to register with the Ministry of Education (MOE). The registration aims to help schools better assess the suitability of instructors in conducting the co-curricular and enrichment activities. </p><p>From January 2015, all government, government-aided, independent, specialised independent and specialised schools will only engage the services of instructors who are registered with MOE in the following areas: </p><ul><li>Co-curricular Activities (CCA) coaches and instructors;</li><li>Art and Music Scheme (AMIS) instructors;</li><li>Programme for Active Learning (PAL) instructors; </li><li>Conversational Chinese/Malay instructors;</li><li>Instructors for activities that involve overnight stay or overseas trips with students;</li><li>All other instructors of school-based co-curricular and enrichment activities with duration of 20 hours or more per contract (for example, one term of weekly two-hour sessions). </li></ul><p>Instructors in the listed areas may apply to register with MOE from 19 March 2014. Application procedures are available at <a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/coaches-instructors">http://www.moe.gov.sg/coaches-instructors</a>. As some schools may begin procuring instructor services for 2015 from June 2014, instructors are encouraged to register by June 2014.</p><p>The instructors will be holistically evaluated based on the following: </p><ul><li>Age (should be at least 18 years of age);</li><li>Area of specialisation;</li><li>Relevant qualifications and experience to the activity concerned (if available); </li><li>Employment history; </li><li>Registration with a relevant professional body (if available);</li><li>Self-declaration form.</li></ul><p>All applicants will be notified by email on the outcome about six weeks after their application. Instructors&#8217; registered status will be valid for two years. Instructors who wish to continue providing such activities are advised to reapply for registration with MOE at least three months prior to the expiry of their registered status.</p><p>Instructors not covered under the listed areas will need to register under a second phase. The second phase comprises instructors engaged for school-based co-curricular and enrichment activities (academic and non-academic) that are more than eight hours (but fewer than 20 hours) per contract. The second phase is expected to commence in 2016. Thereafter, schools will only engage the services of instructors in the second phase if they are registered with MOE. More details on implementation of the second phase will be released in the last quarter of 2014.</p> http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/singapore-education/media/~3/g8a33IcoBdQ/registration-of-instructors-offering-co-curricular-and-enrichment-activities-to-schools.php http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/2014/03/registration-of-instructors-offering-co-curricular-and-enrichment-activities-to-schools.php Thu, 13 Mar 2014 15:30:00 +0800 http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/2014/03/registration-of-instructors-offering-co-curricular-and-enrichment-activities-to-schools.php FY 2014 Committee of Supply Debate: 1st Reply by Mr Heng Swee Keat: Bringing Out the Best in Every Child <p>Madam Speaker, I thank Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Members of this House for your views and suggestions, and I am happy to hear of Mr Lim&#8217;s positive experience in interacting with our students. I am very much encouraged by your support for education and for many of our policies. Your comments add to the rich and diverse views we heard at the year-long Singapore Conversation. </p><p>Mr Low Thia Khiang mentioned about a broader review of our education system. Let me clarify that the Ministry of Education (MOE) has been reviewing our policies on an ongoing basis and, in fact, many significant improvements have been taking place. Both our DPMs were Ministers for Education, and made many important changes along the way. If not for all those continual changes, our system will not be where it is today, with that strength, and that world-class system that DPM Tharman mentioned in his Budget round-up speech.</p><p>Members of this House have raised a wide range of issues. I may not be able to address every point, but I will address the key themes.</p><p>The key goal of my Ministry is to bring out the Best in Every Child.* In Every Domain of Learning; </p><ul><li><p>In Every School; </p></li><li><p>At Every Stage of the Learning Journey;</p></li><li><p>Whatever the Starting Point;</p></li><li><p>To Create A Better Future Together.</p></li></ul><p>By bringing out the best in every child, we give hope and opportunity to enable every child to succeed, and build a better future for all Singaporeans together.</p><p>Our schools provide the common space and the common experiences for our children to build a sense of cohesion as one people, committed to Singapore and fellow Singaporeans. </p><h4>In Every Domain of Learning</h4><p>What do we mean by bringing out the best in every child in every domain of learning? </p><p>Ms Tan Su Shan spoke about preparing for the information age, and about the changes that are going on. Both Ms Tan and Mr Lim Biow Chuan also quoted practices in Google, and indeed, the future environment will be more volatile, unpredictable and complex. The terrain our children will have to navigate will be more unfamiliar, with more unknowns.</p><p>We need to equip our students - not with a map with well-marked paths - rather, we need to equip them with a compass and navigation skills. </p><p>A compass so that each child has a sense of direction, a sense of right and wrong; </p><ul><li><p>It is about character and values;</p></li><li><p>It is about how well they master themselves; </p></li><li><p>It is about resilience and perseverance; </p></li><li><p>And having the empathy, leadership and social skills to work with others, and the heart to contribute to our community and our nation.<br><br></p></li></ul><p>This is the heart of our Character and Citizenship Education.</p><p>We need to equip them with navigation skills so they can analyse situations, apply what they know to solve problems, imagine and invent new possibilities, and chart their own paths. </p><p>This means a strong foundation in core subjects, in numeracy and in literacy, including bilingual literacy. This foundation is necessary for navigating the changing landscape, but not sufficient. </p><p>In recent years, we have emphasised higher-order thinking skills, collaborative and cross-cultural skills to thrive in a globalised information age.</p><p>I thank Ms Irene Ng for reminding us the importance of history. I agree with Ms Ng, an appreciation of our past helps us navigate the future. And indeed, our Character and Citizenship Education, with a strong focus on Values-in-Action and on understanding our past, is progressing well. But we need the support of the community.</p><p>Equipping our students with the inner compass and the navigation skills is a labour of love. </p><p>To do so, we seek to bring out the best in every child in every domain - not just in the academic subjects, but also in CCA, in arts, in music, in sports, and in Values-in-Action projects. </p><p>This is holistic education - it is about developing the whole child. </p><p>Holistic education involves infusing and integrating the learning in different domains, and the development of values and skills in every part of school life, both in and outside of the classroom.</p><p>Let me share briefly how our teachers are taking an integrative, immersive approach in holistic education. </p><ul><li><p>At West Spring Secondary School, students use newspaper articles to discuss social issues. Students gather information, meet with community partners, and generate ideas and possible solutions. One group took the initiative to raise funds for a group of elders to have lunch at an eatery which Dignity Kitchen runs, and worked with the staff to put up a performance.</p></li><li><p>At Kranji Secondary School, Sec 2 students work on interdisciplinary projects in town planning, supported by the URA. Students have to bring together what they have learnt in Geography, English, and Design &amp; Technology. By working with their peers, they build collaboration and communication skills. They also develop creativity and build analytical and organisational skills as they plan together in teams.</p></li></ul><p>So you see, we are starting with all these skills very early on. In fact, many of these projects are also done in our primary schools.</p><p>Our students have done very well in international benchmarking tests, such as PISA. Ms Janice Koh pointed out that test scores alone are not enough. I agree. </p><p>I have looked at the sample questions in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and also our own examination papers - they do challenge our students - to apply knowledge and skills to solve unfamiliar real-life problems, and to use incomplete information, explore indirect relationships and find solutions using unstructured data.</p><p>Neither should we fall into the trap of &#8220;either-or&#8221; thinking - that is, either knowledge or skills. In fact, all over the world, there are fierce debates on this issue and I have been following the debates very closely.</p><p>If creativity is about connecting the dots, you need to have solid dots in the first place or you will have nothing to connect. So, a grasp of the basics is necessary. </p><p>I am not suggesting that we have a perfect system, but I do hope that we take pride in our students&#8217; achievements, and have the confidence to build on that.</p><p>Mr Alvin Yeo mentioned that our children are not so good in the creative field - in the arts. I think it is important for us not to over-generalise. I am sure that we are all proud of our filmmakers, Anthony Chen and Royston Tan, to just name two of them.</p><p>By bringing out the best in every child in every domain, we enable our students to integrate values, knowledge and skills in new and powerful ways, and to go on to navigate changes, solve problems and invent new possibilities.</p><h4>In Every School</h4><p>Let me now touch on how we are bringing out the best in every child in EVERY school.</p><p>Mr Lim Biow Chan, Dr Intan and several Members of this House spoke about every school a good school. </p><p>Let me first share a story. I met Dr Leonard Tan last year. </p><ul><li><p>Leonard came from a low-income family and could not afford music lessons as a child. </p></li><li><p>He joined the school band in Princess Elizabeth Primary School and then Bukit Panjang Government High, where he learnt to play the tuba. This early exposure piqued his interest in music. </p></li><li><p>In Sec 3, he saved up $98 for a violin and taught himself how to play the instrument. In less than two years, he obtained Grade 6 in violin.</p></li><li><p>He went on to pursue his passion in music, first in a junior college in a music elective programme where he met some inspiring teachers, then because of family circumstances, he had to work. Then he went on to LaSalle and NAFA, before getting a scholarship from our National Institute of Education to do his PhD in the US.</p></li></ul><p>Leonard is now an Assistant Professor at National Institute of Education working to develop the next generation of music teachers.</p><p>Now think about it - if not for the school band, Leonard might not have had the opportunity to learn to read music scores or learn the tuba, and then discover his strength and his passion. And Leonard is now contributing back to education and to our society. </p><p>By bringing out the best in every child, our society progresses. Leonard&#8217;s story illustrates that good schools can be places of discovery and nurture for our students, and bring out the best in them - good primary schools, good secondary schools, and beyond.</p><p>Like Dr Intan, I have heard some cynics said: How can every school be a good school when it does not produce the same number of students who have perfect scores compared to the other one?</p><p>To put things into perspective, let me share with you my discussions with parents. I have met many parents who shared with me how different each of their children is - in interests, in temperaments, in aptitudes:</p><ul><li>One is motivated; another requires prodding.</li><li>One thrives under intense competition; another blossoms in a nurturing environment.</li><li>One is theoretical; another is hands-on.</li><li>One is outgoing; another is introverted. </li></ul><p>I am quite sure Members of this House can resonate with that. Same parents, same upbringing - completely different temperaments, interests and aptitudes, and different outcomes.</p><p>But every parent wants to be a good parent, to bring out the best in each of their children. But this does not mean achieving identical outcomes. </p><p>Rather, nurturing parents seek to help each of their children discover his strengths and interests, help each of them build on these, to succeed and to lead a happy, meaningful life.</p><p>If a good parent with just two or three children cannot turn out identical outcomes, nor is judged whether he or she is a good parent on the basis that each of their children turn out the same way, or turn out with equal academic scores, is it right to judge a school with over 1,000 students, as &#8216;good&#8217; or &#8216;not good&#8217;, on the basis of whether it can produce identical academic grades as another school? </p><p>Every School a Good School does not mean Every School the Same School, but it does mean Every School Good in its Own Way, seeking to bring out the Best in Every Child.</p><p>In our 2012 Committee of Supply Debate on MOE, I set out what Every School a Good School means. And this &#8220;Every School a Good School&#8221; has energised our schools, and helped change parents&#8217; perception. I am deeply committed to this, so therefore let me repeat what I said then:</p><ul><li><p>First and foremost, a good school is one that cares for its students. Therefore, it is one that studies and knows the needs, interests and strengths of its students and motivates them to learn and grow.</p></li><li><p>A good school ensures all students acquire strong fundamentals of literacy and numeracy and develops them holistically, in character, knowledge and critical competencies. </p></li><li><p>A good school creates a positive school experience for each student, making him a confident and lifelong learner. </p></li><li><p>A good school has caring and competent teachers who are steadfast in their mission to impact lives. </p></li><li><p>A good school has the support of parents and the community, working together to bring out the best in our children. </p></li><li><p>A good school cares for and provides opportunities to all students, regardless of family circumstances.</p></li></ul><p>I am pleased that many parents are now checking out the schools in our neighbourhood. I am pleased to read in this issue of Young Parents - which says, &#8220;Branded Schools? No thanks. A neighbourhood primary school could be the better choice.&#8221; - on how parents are choosing schools in their neighbourhood that suit their children and raving about their neighbourhood schools. I applaud these parents. Indeed, I fully agree with a comment in the article that it is odd that we call these &#8216;neighbourhood schools&#8217; - after all, are not all schools in the neighbourhood? </p><p>I want to assure you that I am fully committed, together with my team, to making Every School a Good School, and working with you to bring out the best in your child. </p><p>As Dr Intan pointed out, we have many peaks of excellence - peaks built on high bases. So, let us develop more of such peaks, multiply and spread good practices, grow good schools across a range of domains, to better meet the different needs of our children. </p><p>If you survey the school landscape today, we see a more colourful landscape. There are specialised schools in arts, music, sports, science, maths, for applied learning and hands-on learning.</p><p>To add more colour to this landscape and enrich the learning environment, six months ago, I announced that we will have Applied Learning Programmes and Learning for Life Programmes in all our secondary schools. Our schools can get up to $100,000 each for these programmes.</p><p>As an example, Greendale Secondary School has a Design, Technology and Engineering Applied Learning Programme. Students learn cross-disciplinary design thinking skills and to make a difference to others. </p><ul><li>They noticed that the elderly have difficulties taking public transport. </li><li>They invented an &#8220;EZ Card Holder&#8221;, attached to walking sticks. This made it easier for the elderly to tap their EZ-Link cards. The unit has sensors which activate a buzzer when the walking stick falls over, to alert passers-by to provide help immediately. They tested a prototype and were encouraged by the level of interest from the public. </li><li>But it is not just what they invent, but what they learn in the process. Student Nursarah shared that she was able to improve her communication, collaboration and problem solving skills - the skills that Ms Tan Su Shan and Ms Janice Koh both mentioned.</li></ul><p>As you can see, our secondary schools have a variety of programmes in visual and performing arts, physical education and sports science, community and youth leadership, and many others. </p><p>Mr Inderjit Singh and Mrs Lina Chiam spoke about resourcing of our schools. Mrs Chiam mentioned about cuts to independent school funding. I have clarified in this House that we are not cutting independent school funding per se. Rather, as a result of the review, six independent schools actually got more funds, and four had their funds reduced as part of a rationalisation exercise.</p><p>Mrs Chiam also cited reduced development funding for our secondary schools. Let me clarify that that is because upgrading projects have been completed. But our operating expenditure for our secondary schools has been increasing.</p><p>One way to make Every School a Good School a reality is by resourcing our schools based on their needs. </p><p>Every school gets baseline funding and good infrastructure. This includes rolling out indoor sports halls in every school, synthetic fields for every school that needs it; and PERI facilities as a result of the review earlier on - music room, dance studios, student care centres (SCCs), and so on. </p><p>Where appropriate, we will build specialised infrastructure fit-for-purpose. If we need a commercial-scale teaching kitchen, like at Crest Secondary - we will invest. And in fact, I have seen that lovely kitchen that is used to teach our students. If we need a laboratory for applied learning - we will invest. </p><p>But let me emphasise that it is not just about facilities and resources.</p><p>The more I interact with educators and our specialists, the more I appreciate that teaching and learning are complex and intricate processes. It is not one specific subject, lesson, or way of doing things. It is not even about smaller class sizes per se.</p><p>It is about inspiring teachers who lead, care and inspire. It is about teachers who weave together curriculum, co-curricular activities, Values-In-Action programmes into teachable moments. They create an integrative and immersive environment, to create the opportunities for success, to encourage students to strive to learn. </p><p>Just like what the schools had done for Dr Leonard Tan.</p><p>Our key strength in our national school system is in having a strong core of good teachers and principals across all our schools, committed to making Every School a Good School and bringing out the best in every child. </p><p>These dedicated educators also constantly look for innovative ways to bring out the best in every child. So, we also appreciate good ideas that are surfaced to us. </p><p>Mr Inderjit has been raising the issue of streaming for many years, including in previous Parliaments. As early as 2010, in the last Parliament, Ms Denise Phua expressed concerns about high stake PSLE exams and pushed for changes. </p><p>MOE takes a systematic approach to making changes. </p><ul><li>We already have subject-based banding in primary schools to prepare students for standard and foundational subjects at PSLE. </li><li>Starting this year, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) students in 12 secondary schools will be allowed to take some subjects at a higher level starting from Sec 1.</li></ul><p>Mr Yee Jenn Jong and Ms Denise Phua spoke about integrated schools. In fact, Ms Phua also presented a detailed proposal on Primary to Secondary Integrated School in Parliament in January - the key elements which she repeated today - and which in the earlier session I responded to. </p><ul><li><p>I appreciate that Ms Phua is a hands-on practitioner who understands the complexity of education. She has pioneered many innovative and effective practices in Pathlight and Eden Schools for children with autism. So I would like to assure Ms Phua again that we will give her proposal serious consideration. </p></li><li><p>It will take us some time to evaluate Members&#8217; ideas - whether it is cluster schools, or broader development of talent, or through-train, because there are really a range of ideas that we can all explore. </p></li><li><p>We can always do more for our schools, teachers and students to bring out the best in every child. </p></li></ul><p>But let me mention a very important initiative that we have just embarked on. We are currently expanding the range of programmes and mix of programmes across our schools, and creating a more colourful landscape with more distinctive schools. This is part of our effort of making every school a good school. Each good in its own way, with its peaks of excellence as Dr Intan pointed out, well-resourced with good teachers, and with varied programmes. </p><h5>At Every Stage of the Learning Journey</h5><p>Even as we continue our efforts across our schools, we are also bringing out the best in every child at every stage of the learning journey.</p><p>Education is not a timed-obstacle race, to collect qualifications in the fastest possible time - rather, our children&#8217;s education is a journey of discovering their strengths, building their compass and their navigation skills. </p><p>This journey has many stages, and is a lifelong one. It never ends.</p><p>At each stage, a child learns what is appropriate for that age, and builds the basics for the next stage. To make learning meaningful, each stage needs to be rigorous, well-designed and appropriate for the development of the child.</p><p>At pre-school, our children develop socio-emotional skills through play, and acquire the basics of numeracy and bilingual literacy. </p><p>We build on this foundation in primary schools.</p><p>Queenstown Primary was the first school I visited on my first day of work when I joined MOE as Minister, and I recently visited it again. I am very glad they have made so much progress in just two odd years. Their students are now exposed to a rich variety of stimulus - in reading, writing, mathematics, arts, music, physical education and social interaction. They enjoy quality interaction with their form teachers, in dedicated Form Teacher Guidance Periods. I saw how deeply engaged our young students were on the day.</p><p>This is not just in Queenstown Primary, it is happening across all our primary schools. </p><p>In secondary schools, we help our students to pursue and deepen their strengths and interests, and further develop higher order skills. </p><p>In the post-secondary years, our students can make the best use of our wide range of pathways to progress. It is remarkable that today, 96% of each cohort already progress to post-secondary education - almost universal - up from just 88% a decade ago.</p><p>I should add that not many countries are able to achieve this.</p><p>Over the years, we have made these distinct pathways more interconnected to allow students to progress at different stages of their development, with many more entry points - Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP), Direct Entry Scheme to Polytechnic Programme (DPP), Enhanced Nitec Foundation Programme (e-NFP). All this is about creating more opportunities for our students. </p><p>We can be proud of our post-secondary students&#8217; achievements. </p><p>This is Miss Catherine Boey. She is the world&#8217;s best in beauty therapy. </p><ul><li><p>Catherine won the Gold Medal for the Beauty Therapy Skill Area at the WorldSkills Competition in 2013 - the WorldSkills competition is hailed as the Olympics of Skills. I met Catherine, together with many of our winners at the biennial WorldSkills Competition. This is a very intense competition and you can hear the drama that they go through. </p></li><li><p>I am proud that our ITE and Polytechnic students outshone those from more advanced economies, from economies that have a longer history of skills based training. It is a testament to the hard work of these students and the quality and standing of our ITE and our Polytechnics. </p></li></ul><p>Catherine credits ITE and WorldSkills for providing her the opportunity to hone her skills, building her confidence in handling stressful situations and learning how to work and interact with people from all over the world. </p><p>She takes pride in her skills and I am very happy that she wants to pass it on to others. She is currently a Teaching Associate at ITE, and will be pursuing further studies on an ITE Scholarship this year, and then return to ITE as a lecturer after her studies. She hopes to be a role model to inspire her students to believe in themselves and achieve their dreams. </p><p>Catherine is just one example of how we are bringing out the best in each child at every stage of the learning journey. </p><h5>ASPIRE</h5><p>DPM Tharman in his round-up speech for the Budget debate affirmed this government&#8217;s commitment to invest in every talent, not just in schools, but in lifelong learning.</p><p>Indeed, to enable our young to seize opportunities, we must make a major shift in our mindsets, to go beyond qualifications, to build deep skills and expertise in every student.</p><p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan spoke earlier on the importance of skills to ensure that our young can continue to access opportunities. We need to embrace the idea of craftsmanship and professionalism seriously, and encourage our students to pursue their areas of strengths. In doing so, develop a culture of mastery on the job, seeking not just competence but excellence. </p><p>This starts with the basics. Film artist, Nor Azman Mohammed Rohman, has a job which many young people dream of. He is in Lucasfilm, and had worked on blockbusters like &#8220;Star Trek: Into Darkness&#8221; and &#8220;Pacific Rim&#8221;. He said, &#8220;You have to have the patience to learn the basics properly and to get the fundamentals right.&#8221; (Straits Times, 5 March 2014).</p><p>Beyond getting the basics right, it must continue with a habit of lifelong learning to develop one&#8217;s talent. </p><p>The learning has to take place, day-in, day-out, on the job, and through professional upgrading. Only then can the virtues of craftsmanship and professionalism be built and deepened - taking pride in one&#8217;s work and developing a culture of excellence.</p><p>I have met many Polytechnic and ITE students, and I enjoy our interactions. Their energy and drive to do well, and their passion is infectious. </p><p>I am proud of them, and I want to do more for them.</p><p>That is why we set up the ASPIRE committee chaired by SMS Indranee. </p><p>We will be working in close partnership with various industries to pioneer new pathways to develop the professionalism and craftsmanship of our young. I thank Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Dr Intan for speaking about ASPIRE earlier.</p><p>For two years now, I have officiated at the Singapore-Industry Scholarship (SgIS) Award Ceremony. We identified companies which are serious about developing a strong core of Singaporeans with deep skills and expertise to anchor strategic industries. Close to 200 scholarships had been given. </p><p>We are also expanding degree places, with distinctive applied degree pathways to be offered by SIT and UniSIM. Many Singaporean students will benefit.</p><p>These are all part of a larger effort to move beyond qualifications to a stronger focus on skills and expertise, on developing one&#8217;s professional depth on the job, on developing craftsmanship, and on developing the instincts to pull together different strands of knowledge to solve real-world problems and to invent new possibilities. It is a very exciting development and a very major effort. SMS Indranee will speak more about ASPIRE later.</p><h5>Review of PSLE, DSA</h5><p>By now, I hope Members appreciate the important shifts that we are making to continue to bring out the best in every child at every stage of their learning journey. </p><p>If we see education as a long journey, then primary school is just one stage of this journey.</p><p>It is within this context that we are reviewing PSLE scoring and Direct School Admissions (DSA), as PM mentioned during the National Day Rally (NDR) last year. Changes to PSLE scoring will support a more holistic education for our students.</p><p>PSLE will provide the assessment to help each child decide on the next step of his education journey that is best given his pace of development.</p><p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan spoke about this earlier - that the PSLE score should not determine a student&#8217;s future, and that whatever the results, it is for students to make the best out of their secondary education in school. I fully agree. </p><p>Mr Low Thia Khiang spoke about the need to be careful about the changes. I agree with Mr Low; that is why we are calibrating our changes carefully. </p><p>The PSLE is a long-standing assessment in our education system. I have been listening to feedback at Our Singapore Conversation - both the broader one as well as the MOE focused one - and at other platforms. I fully appreciate the concerns voiced over timing and posting criteria for admissions to secondary school. It is still some time before we implement the changes. </p><p>I want to assure that there will be no sudden changes. We will give parents, teachers, and schools sufficient time to adjust.</p><p>Right now we are focused on working with parents so that they may better understand the variegated landscape of our schools, and indeed meet the interests of their children, and therefore, how to make best use of the many pathways available, to bring out the best in their children - not in terms of their PSLE scores, but in every domain. It is to prepare their children for the future. </p><p>We will release more details on the PSLE in due course. </p><p>MPs Hri Kumar and Ang Wei Neng spoke about DSA. DSA recognises a broader range of abilities. It helps students enter schools with programmes that can develop their strengths and interests. </p><p>We will be broadening DSA to consider personal qualities of students, such as character, resilience, drive and leadership. In fact, some secondary schools already consider these qualities through interviews, selection camps, feedback from primary schools, and so on.</p><p>We will make a small but important change by making this practice consistent in ALL schools with DSA, to emphasise the importance of personal qualities. Let me emphasise that we are not adding a new DSA category. We are not increasing the total number of DSA places.</p><p>As parents have told me: &#8220;Do not create a new source of pressure for students.&#8221; Parents need not worry that you will have to send your children for enrichment classes to prepare for this.</p><p>The reason is this. Primary schools can identify the small handful of children with exceptional personal qualities. This is most obvious when a child thrives despite adversity brought about by life&#8217;s inevitable difficulties. I have met quite a number of these students myself.</p><p>Primary schools will look out for suitable programmes in secondary schools based on strengths of the child. Secondary schools taking in these students will consider them holistically in DSA selection. </p><p>The rest of the DSA process remains largely unchanged. </p><p>Some parents and teachers warned: it is difficult to quantify personal qualities! And indeed, we fully appreciate this. These are qualitative aspects, best observed through daily interactions over a sustained period of time in school.</p><p>In short, our children&#8217;s education is a long journey. PSLE should be an important checkpoint so as to better support our children in their learning journey. DSA provides a pathway for students to develop areas of interest and strength.</p><p>The changes we are making are important, but do see it as part of a broader effort to support the holistic development of each child, and to bring out the best in every child, so as to prepare our children better for the future.</p><p>I want to emphasise that there are many interconnected pathways to success, and at every stage of the journey. Let us equip every child with a strong inner compass and navigation skills to excel in the future.</p><h5>Whatever the Starting Point</h5><p>I have just spoken on how we are bringing out the best in every child at every stage of the learning journey. But some worry that there are children who cannot access the opportunities at various stages. </p><p>Let me now touch on how we bring out the best in every child, in every domain, in every school, at every stage of the learning journey, whatever the child&#8217;s starting point.</p><p>Making this happen is close to the hearts of many of us who work in education. </p><p>We must strive for our education system to be open and inclusive. Children have different needs: learning needs, special needs and financial needs. </p><p>MOE is committed to do more to support these students, at all levels.</p><p>Our approach is comprehensive:</p><ul><li><p>Levelling-up programmes for literacy and numeracy, </p></li><li><p>Pastoral and student-care support,</p></li><li><p>Special needs support, and</p></li><li><p>Financial support.</p></li></ul><h5>Support for Learning Needs - Pre-school, Levelling-Up Programmes, Whole-School Approaches, SCCs</h5><p>Let us follow a child&#8217;s learning journey through the various stages, and how we will support them. Entering pre-school, if a child is weak in his ABCs, he can benefit from Focused Language Assistance in Reading (FLAiR). </p><p>Going into primary school, what if our child is not as strong with reading and numbers? I announced the expansion of our Learning Support Programmes and other levelling up programmes for English and Mathematics in Parliament last year. These programmes provide support for the weaker 15% of each cohort throughout the primary school years, and if necessary, right through for the rest of the 10 years of basic education.</p><p>We already invest up to 20% more on these students over the course of their primary education, compared to the average, and this will increase to 40% by 2017 as we expand these programmes. I would like to assure Mr Inderjit Singh that we are very mindful of the importance of these programmes to bring out the best in every child. </p><p>We are developing a critical mass of expert teachers to support this effort. </p><p>After primary school, in addition to school-based assistance, we also adopt a whole-school approach for some. Members are aware of the good outcomes of NorthLight School (NLS) and Assumption Pathway School (APS) in developing students who fail the PSLE. </p><p>Before these schools were established, attrition rates were as high as 60% for this group of students. We have managed to lower this to 10 -15% in a few short years. This is a remarkable success. What it means is that many lives are transformed, many lives are changed for the better, and some children really blossom in these schools and discover the best in themselves. Many more are progressing to ITE and transiting to meaningful employment. </p><p>So, building on this success, we started Crest Secondary School (CSS) and Spectra Secondary School (SSS). This provides an alternative pathway for Normal (Technical) students. Again the response has been encouraging. I have spoken to some of the parents myself. Attendance rates are close to 100%. More importantly, students are engaged</p><p>These are all significant interventions. Whatever a child&#8217;s starting point in terms of learning, there is support to help to bring out the best in him. </p><p>Mr Inderjit Singh expressed concerns that we are labelling students. Let me assure him that this is not the intention. As one of the board members of these schools once told me, and I quote: &#8220;The best antidote to stigma is success&#8221;. He can speak with authority on this, having been once a student who struggled in a regular school. He goes on to say: &#8220;Between stigma and an opportunity to excel, I would choose opportunity to excel, rather than &#8230; slowly see your interest dwindle away.&#8221;</p><p>Learning is not just about ABCs and 123s. I am also a firm believer in the importance of social-emotional learning. </p><p>Beyond academic support, we are strengthening socio-emotional support through a number of programmes, including the expansion of school-based Student Care Centres. Dr Intan and Mr Yee Jenn Jong both spoke on this.</p><p>And I agree with Dr Intan that, indeed, Student Care Centres provide a conducive environment for learning, especially for those from less advantaged backgrounds. We have significantly expanded these centres in the past few years. </p><p>Just three years ago we had fewer than 40, now we have 80 school-based Student Care Centres in our primary schools. I have visited many of our Student Care Centres, and it is a joy to see happy, engaged children. </p><p>I am happy to announce that over the next two years, we will increase the number of school-based Student Care Centres by 50% or 40 more. That means, by the end of next year, almost two-thirds of our primary schools will have Student Care Centres. </p><p>I look forward to more innovative care programmes, and even more happy and engaged children. Mr Alvin Yeo spoke about full day school. Let us start by having really good Student Care Centres in our schools.</p><h5>Support for Special Needs - SDR, DSO, SEN</h5><p>I spoke about bringing out the best in every child whatever his starting point in terms of learning needs. What about special needs? Ms Phua has been a passionate advocate for us to do more to support the needs of students with special needs.</p><p>We have significantly enhanced support for children with special needs in schools and IHLs. </p><p>We continue to work closely with VWO-run special education (SPED) schools to improve their curriculum and enhance our support to them. Many of us, including MOS Sim Ann and myself, have visited many of these schools, and they are doing very good work.</p><p>I have also met many students with dyslexia, and know many successful adults who had dyslexia. With intervention, they can learn to overcome their difficulties and build a good foundation in literacy. </p><p>Our pilot programmes have been very helpful for children with dyslexia. From this year, we have expanded school-based dyslexia remediation to 20 more schools - making it a total of 62 such schools, spread across the island. </p><p>Before I go on, let me share a reflection on Singaporeans with special needs. I had the privilege of working with:</p><ul><li><p>Ms Chia Yong Yong, President of Society for the Physically Disabled in Our Singapore Conversation Committee, and now with</p></li><li><p>Dr Yeo Sze Ling, research scientist at A*Star, in our Singapore50 Committee.</p></li></ul><p>Yong Yong has a muscular disorder and Sze Ling lost her sight at age four. They show great tenacity and have come a long way. They are cheerful and optimistic. They embody that &#8220;can do&#8221; spirit. They made a success of their own lives and go on to contribute to others.</p><p>Members would have read in the papers, when the A Level results were released, of Amanda Chong, a Pioneer JC student who suffered glaucoma at the age of three, and lost her vision at end of JC1. Her studies suffered, especially in Economics and Mathematics which are graphics-heavy. Despite that, she went on to do extremely well at her A levels. I am not lauding her just for her grades - but rather for her remarkable spirit.</p><p>As one of our educators shared with me, &#8220;While the world became pitch dark to her, the darkness did not consume her. Instead, she continued to see beauty in her life and brought light, hope and inspiration to the people around her.&#8221; It is truly, truly inspiring.</p><p>Each year, about 1% of our students who enter the ITE, Polytechnics or publicly-funded universities have some form of special education needs. I agree with Ms Denise Phua that we must do more to support our children, so that needs do not mean limits, and that we can bring out their very best - so that we may have many more Yong Yongs, Sze Lings and Amandas. </p><p>We will be setting up Disability Support Offices in ITE, all Polytechnics, arts institutions, and publicly-funded universities. A Special Education Needs Fund will also be set aside to alleviate the cost of assistive technology devices and support services. </p><p>I feel strongly that these enhancements will make a significant difference to the students. MOS Sim Ann will speak more on this later.</p><h5>Support for Financial Needs - Enhancements to IHL Bursaries</h5><p>I have covered learning needs, special educational needs. I would like to now touch on financial needs. </p><p>Let me first acknowledge our Singapore parents. An admirable trait of our parents is that whatever their financial circumstances, they put their children&#8217;s education first and foremost. I have met many such parents myself. I want to help parents succeed in bringing out the best in every one of their children. </p><p>Financial circumstances should not be a limiting factor.</p><p>Starting from pre-school level, on top of generous Child Care subsidies, DPM Tharman announced the Kindergarten Fee Assistance Scheme (KiFAS). Minister for MSF will provide details later, but I am happy to add that for MOE Kindergartens, this could mean paying as low as $1.50 a month. </p><p>We have also significantly enhanced coverage of financial support in schools over the years. In 2012, we expanded the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) for students. This year, bursaries for students at Independent Schools were enhanced. More than 68,000 students benefited last year. This is more than a four-fold increase from a decade ago. </p><p>MOE has also provided more funds for our schools this year for school-based financial assistance so that schools can act flexibly on the ground and schools with more needy students get more funds. We also have the Opportunity Fund to ensure students from less advantaged backgrounds are not denied learning opportunities in school. </p><p>From pre-school to the 10 years of basic education, there is good support for bringing out the best in every child, whatever his financial starting point.</p><p>Higher education in Singapore is already highly subsidised, and MOE is committed to making higher education even more accessible to our students. This is a very important phase for bringing out their best.</p><p>From academic year 2014, students from lower and middle income families in our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) will receive more substantial financial support.</p><p>We will make higher education more accessible for lower and middle income groups, in two ways: </p><ul><li><p>By raising the income thresholds for bursaries, and</p></li><li><p>By raising bursary amounts.</p></li></ul><p>This means more Singaporean students will qualify for bursaries, and they will each get more. In all, 120,000 Singaporean students stand to benefit.</p><p>For students from low income families, </p><ul><li><p>If they are enrolled in ITE, the bursaries will not only fully cover the fees - which is about $310 - but provide for living allowances of about $50 to $70 a month. </p></li><li><p>If they are in Polytechnics, 80% of the fees for the lower income students will be covered by the bursary of $2,000.</p></li><li><p>University students in lower income families will have about 45% of their fees covered - almost half. </p></li></ul><p>Students from the middle income households will also benefit from a sizable increase in the bursary quantum. These changes, together the recent concessions on transport fares for Polytechnic students, will reduce the financial burden of many students. </p><p>I should reiterate that these bursaries come on top of the very high level of subsidies which all students in our IHLs already enjoy, regardless of family income.</p><p>By ensuring access to high-quality education opportunities, we aim to bring out the best in every child, whatever his financial starting point, learning needs and special education needs. </p><h5>In Partnership with Teachers, Parents and Community</h5><p>I have said we want to bring out the best in every child, in every domain, in every school, at every stage of the learning journey, whatever the starting point. To achieve this, we have to do it in partnership with the community.</p><p>As the old adage goes: it takes a village to raise a child. We are not just raising a child, but bringing out his best. In not just any village, but one that really cares and is fully committed to this mission. </p><p>When a child can reach his best, the whole village rejoices and benefits - as my story of Dr Leonard Tan illustrates, and Ms Catherine Boey, and in all the students who have gone on to achieve their best.</p><h5>Teachers</h5><p>There are many excellent teachers, allied educators, counsellors, and psychologists in our school system. I have met many myself: </p><ul><li><p>Last month, at the Pioneer Generation Tribute Event, I met teachers who, together, have accumulated thousands of years of experience between them. Some are still teaching, some passing on their experiences to younger teachers. They have brought out the best in their students, seen for themselves their students reaching their best. Younger teachers who met them that day were inspired. There is a long and deep tradition of care in our teaching service.</p></li><li><p>Last month, I gave out National Day awards to over 280 teachers who made the difference to many students, and in the room, you could feel their dedication and their passion for their students - it is remarkable. </p></li><li><p>In Nov 2012, I attended the Singapore International Science Teachers&#8217; Conference held during the school holidays. Every one of the 500 participants had signed up voluntarily. All had this passion to improve their skills in order to teach our children better. So they are learning to teach, and I hope that they also teach to learn.</p></li></ul><p>Mrs Lina Chiam raised the issue of teachers&#8217; well-being. Indeed, this is very much at the heart of our concern. Over the last few years alone, we have significantly increased the number of teachers, allied educators, that support our teachers in teaching and learning and in behavioural support, as well as our executive and administrative staff in our schools. I want to assure Mrs Chiam and Ms Janice Koh that if you look at the international comparisons of the number of teachers to the number of students in our school system, we can hold our head high. As I have said, it is not just about numbers, it is really about the heart; in getting the right people with the heart for teaching. Our school leaders are very caring leaders who provide flexibility for teachers. </p><p>When we want to bring out the best in our children, we need to help our teachers reach their personal and professional best too. </p><p>I am committed to enabling our teachers to continue to grow. I applaud the culture of dedication, sharing and professional-led excellence. Our teachers are lifelong students. </p><p>In the coming years, the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST) and our specialised teachers&#8217; academies will do even more to lead and inspire the continuing professional development of our teachers. </p><p>Many teachers are also forming spontaneous networks of learning communities to share effective practices. For example, teachers in the Normal (Technical) Professional Focus Group come together to share and learn one another&#8217;s best practices that bring out the best in their students. When the teachers themselves grow and feel fulfilled, motivated and supported, the students under them can blossom.</p><h5>Parents</h5><p>Let me say a few words about parents. Parents are every child&#8217;s first, and most important, teachers. We are fortunate to have a culture where parents want an active role in their child&#8217;s learning. We respect and appreciate that.</p><p>We must work together with parents to bring out the best in their children. Over the last few years, schools have stepped up their efforts to work hand-in-hand with parents. I heartily support this, and hope to see even more. </p><p>MOE had seeded funding through the Parent Support Group (PSG) Fund.</p><p>To keep up the good partnership, we will provide an annual top-up of up to $2,500 per school to fund our schools&#8217; parent engagement efforts. </p><p>SPS Hawazi and MOS Sim Ann will also talk about how our parents and the community have enabled our children to have richer learning experiences - be it in bilingualism or learning about our region.</p><h5>To Create a Better Future Together</h5><p>Singapore is a young country, but we have a wealth of wisdom in our pioneers and a wealth of spirit in our young. </p><p>As we approach our 50th year of Independence, let us honour the efforts of our forefathers, particularly educators in the Pioneer Generation who built up the education system to what it is today. With very little, they achieved a lot.</p><p>I met Mrs Niva Dutt at the Pioneer Generation event - she was the former Principal of Cedar Girls. She had brought her grandson along. She told me - I quote &#8220;I want him to learn from this Pioneer Generation, about hard work and sacrifice, and to remember to respect them&#8221;. What was most touching was that the young man was most enthusiastic to speak with the teachers who were there and learn from them.</p><p>My hope is that each child can reach his best and go on to be a pioneer in his own way, inspiring others and passing on the best to generations to come. Like our pioneers have done.</p><p>To do this, our children need to have strong skills, character and values, a strong commitment to Singapore and fellow Singaporeans, and a strong conviction that they have all of our fullest support and love.</p><p>I hope Members can see how we are seeking to Bring Out the Best in Every Child: </p><blockquote>In Every Domain of Learning.<br>In Every School.<br>At Every Stage of the Learning Journey.<br>Whatever the Starting Point.<br><br>To Create a Better Future - Together.</blockquote> http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/singapore-education/media/~3/rCMoAo-Oln0/first-reply-by-mr-heng-swee-keat-bringing-out-the-best-in-every-child.php http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/speeches/2014/03/07/first-reply-by-mr-heng-swee-keat-bringing-out-the-best-in-every-child.php key Fri, 07 Mar 2014 23:50:00 +0800 http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/speeches/2014/03/07/first-reply-by-mr-heng-swee-keat-bringing-out-the-best-in-every-child.php FY 2014 Committee of Supply Debate: Reply by SMS Indranee Rajah <p>What is the ultimate purpose of education? As Minister Heng indicated, it is to bring out the best in every child, and to prepare them for the future - not only for jobs but also for life. All the initiatives and steps that we have taken are with these goals in mind.</p><p>Minister has given a macro overview. I will deal with two specific areas - Tertiary and Pre-school. We have, step by step, been transforming the tertiary education landscape.</p><h4>From 2000 to CUEP</h4><p>Prior to 2000, we had two universities - NUS and NTU. </p><p>In 2000, SMU was established. It introduced the US-style university, complementing the other two older universities modelled along British lines.</p><p>In 2009, SUTD was established, with a focus on design, engineering training and research.In 2010, the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) was set up, providing an additional upgrading pathway for poly graduates.</p><p>In Aug 2012, the Committee on University Education Pathways Beyond 2015 (CUEP), chaired by then Senior Minister of State for Education and Information, Communications and the Arts Mr Lawrence Wong, made several key recommendations in its report: </p><p>One, to increase the cohort participation in our publicly funded universities.</p><p>And two, to have a new applied degree pathway. I want to spend some time explaining this idea of an applied pathway because I am not sure it is well understood across the board, but it is very important.</p><p>The applied pathway focuses on the practical application of specialised knowledge and prepares students for specific professions with a strong nexus with the industry and economy.</p><p>SIT and UniSIM were identified as the two new applied universities, the other universities being research universities. </p><p>The report also recommended Continuing Education and Training for lifelong learning and financial assistance for mature students taking part-time degrees at UniSIM.</p><p>You can see how, step by step but with gathering momentum, we have been diversifying the university landscape and increasing the opportunities for young Singaporeans.</p><p>With that part underway, we are now focusing on the polytechnics and ITE. This brings me to ASPIRE.</p><h4>ASPIRE</h4><p>In Nov 2013, PM Lee announced the formation of the committee for the <a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/aspire/">Applied Study in Polytechnics and ITE Review (or ASPIRE)</a>, which I am chairing.</p><p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked for an update of the committee&#8217;s work, Mr Yee Jenn Jong spoke about internships, and Ms Lina Chiam spoke about international exposure for students and the promotion of entrepreneurship.</p><p>These are the issues which ASPIRE is looking at. Before I go on to the details of ASPIRE, let me first explain the driving considerations behind its work.</p><p>Mr Chairman, with your permission, may I ask the Clerks to distribute the handouts and display some slides on the LED screens regarding youth unemployment rates around the world?</p><p>This chart shows the state of youth unemployment based on figures from a 2012 OECD report. You will see right at the top of the chart, with 51% youth unemployment, Greece and Spain. Portugal and Italy, with 36% youth unemployment. These are understandably due to economic conditions. </p><p>However, in the US according to their Bureau of Statistics, there are 3.8 million job openings while approximately 11.8 million are unemployed. This suggests that one reason for part of their unemployment rate is a mismatch between skills and qualifications in demand and the skills and qualifications that people have.</p><p>The Finnish and Korean figures, 19.4% and 9.5% respectively, also tell us that a degree qualification is not a guarantee of a job - there must be alignment between skills supply and job demand.</p><p>Germany and Switzerland, on the other hand, have low youth unemployment rates, 7.9% and 7.5% respectively - and one of the key reasons is their strong vocational education and training through apprenticeships, which ensures that many students leave their system with skills relevant to available jobs.</p><p>So that&#8217;s the first thing, aligning skills and demand. </p><p>The second is equipping Singaporeans for the future. DPM Tharman, a few days ago, highlighted the unpredictability of the future workplace and how digitalisation is transforming not just businesses but jobs.</p><p>When I first started work as a lawyer 26 years ago, we had what was considered the forefront of technology at that time:</p><p>The electronic typewriter with a two-line screen, used by the secretary;A telex machine, used by telex operator;A fax machine, operated by fax operator; andThe phone routed through the switchboard that was operated by a phone operator</p><p>Four different machines, handled by four different people, four different jobs. Today, we have the iPhone. All of those functions can be done by this. And those jobs are gone, except probably for the secretary role, which will always be needed. This one single device has disrupted jobs and changed the economic scene. </p><p>Today you can have a job as an app designer - this job not only did not exist 26 years ago, but the possibility of its existence was not even in anyone&#8217;s contemplation back then. What has happened before, will happen again, so the question is how our education system can help prepare our students for life and a career, now and in the future.</p><p>These are the goals of ASPIRE:</p><ul><li>Ensuring our poly and ITE students are highly employable with highly sought-after skills. We want them to have different options to progress upwards;</li><li>We want to give them the skills to navigate the volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous environment ahead - we want them to have resilience, leadership, adaptability, problem solving, communication skills; and </li><li>We also want to lay the foundation for them to become workers with highly-sought-after skills, entrepreneurs, innovators and business owners.</li></ul><p>We hope to achieve this by strengthening the applied learning in the polys and ITE because applied learning, by its very nature, promotes these outcomes.</p><p>I led a trip to Switzerland and Germany last month to study their applied education model. It was a good learning experience. But as each country is unique, we can&#8217;t simply replicate what they have. At the same time, we saw many familiar elements which assured us that we are on the right track. We have in place many of the pieces that have led to their success - strong vocational training institutions, industry-relevant training and industry partnerships. However there were also takeaways and ideas from which we can learn. </p><p>We went to a company, and in that company, they had set up another company. The students were the managing director, accountant, chief financial officer, and had to take their own orders. This was a subsidiary that they ran as a company, but putting the students in there so that the students would get corporate experience to make the kind of decisions you would have to make in real life.</p><p>The things ASPIRE is currently considering include:</p><ul><li>Enhanced internships;</li><li>And the value of applied learning through enhanced internships are as follows;</li><li>Aligning skills to industry demand, so that our students can be assured of a job; </li><li>Combining theory and practice; and</li><li>Making sure the real life environment facilitates the learning of the lifeskills I mentioned earlier, and provides a strong base for being a skilled worker, business owner or entrepreneur.</li></ul><p>This is Mr James Tan, who is currently a Duty Terminal Manager with Changi Airport Group (CAG). James did his internship at Changi Airport and he was awarded the &#8220;Extra Mile Award&#8221; by CAG for his performance. Due to his outstanding contribution during internship, he was the first intern to be recruited to become a Duty Terminal Manager since the commencement of CAG&#8217;s Changi Youth Ambassador Programme.</p><p>We are also considering:</p><ul><li>Progression pathways and opportunities, where promotions and progress are based on competencies and skills;</li><li>The use of skills frameworks or professional/industry certifications to achieve this;</li><li>And we would like to pilot them in suitable sectors; </li><li>We also want to have enhanced career guidance to get a better matching of student strengths to the courses that they take; and </li><li>We&#8217;re also looking at support for students who have difficulties and who are not meeting full potential, especially those at risk of dropping out. </li></ul><p>So you can see, graduating from poly or ITE is also not an end in itself, but a wonderful beginning. We are looking at Continuing Education and Training for poly and ITE students so that they can continue to learn and progress even after they graduate from poly and ITE. We want them to have options to:</p><ul><li>Work immediately after graduation;</li><li>Pursue further studies after graduation;</li><li>Work first and then continue with education or get professional or technical certifications;</li><li>Get further training after valuable working experience; or </li><li>Become business owners or entrepreneurs.</li></ul><p>I had a case at my Meet-the-People Session - an ITE student came to see me for an appeal. He wanted to pursue a technical diploma in automotive engineering as he wanted to have his own automotive business. He wants to be a boss, not an employee, and he is pursuing his dream through the ITE route.</p><p>ASPIRE is also reviewing how to strengthen and deepen Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) in polys and ITE. Not many people realise this, but our polys and ITE are centres of RIE. </p><p>Can I invite members to have a look at the screen and have a guess what it is. It is actually an edible nutrient sheet developed by Singapore Poly&#8217;s Food Innovation and Research Centre in collaboration with industry. So you can see the green part is broccoli, the orange part is carrot mash, the red part that forms the car is beetroot, the wheels are spinach and the ground is ground-up mushroom. And this is ideal for getting young children to eat their vegetables. It is also very good for transportation. And when I asked them whether they had preservatives, they said no, and that was a good thing. What you do is, you put it over warm rice, and then it softens, and you can eat it. </p><p>The second one is a device attached to the kidney area and if you feel a twinge looking at it, there is a reason. This is called a Percutaneous Access to Kidney Assist Device but basically what it does is to help the surgeon to hold steady when locating a kidney stone, so his hand doesn&#8217;t shake and it is much easier when you conduct the surgery. This is developed by ITE&#8217;s Technology Development Centre with NUS and NUH.</p><p>So this hands-on, practice-oriented, problem-solving nature of applied learning in the polys and ITE, as well as the research, innovation and enterprise project work that the students do, is uniquely suited to developing young entrepreneurs.</p><p>One such entrepreneur is Mr Darren Nathan, who is a Ngee Ann Poly (NP) graduate and a technopreneur. He developed a useful base of skills in poly. After NS, with support from NP and SPRING, he commercialised the research that he did at NP and co-founded Progeniq, which provides high performance computing solutions, helping digital animators speed up production of visual effects in Hollywood and Bollywood films.</p><p>But ASPIRE&#8217;s work is not without challenges. </p><h4>Challenges</h4><p>As we saw in Europe, a critical enabler is strong industry ownership of vocational training. Over there, it is the companies who are responsible for taking on apprentices, and they provide the training. They help the apprentices to find schools to provide the theoretical education. </p><p>Employers see themselves as co-developers of talent and invest heavily in training and teaching of employees. But they derive a benefit in terms of access to skilled employees and a recruitment pipeline. </p><p>Here, employers regard career education as the task of the educational institutions, rather than as a joint endeavour. In order for us to achieve the outcomes outlined earlier, there will have to be a much deeper collaboration and co-ownership between industry and the IHLs, and this will require a mindset shift.</p><p>However I am cheered by the interest that has been expressed by industries so far and we are working with them to develop a viable model that suits Singapore&#8217;s circumstances.</p><p>Another challenge is how we view vocational training and jobs. Right now it is still a paper chase. We have to see each job as something valuable in its own right, and place value on professionalism, technical skills and craftsmanship.</p><p>As has been said: &#8220;It&#8217;s not what you know; it&#8217;s what you can do with what you know&#8221;. </p><p>So you can see, ASPIRE&#8217;s work is multi-faceted, and we will not be able to achieve what we hope to, unless all the stakeholders are on board.</p><p>So for the composition of ASPIRE committee, we have private sector representatives and people from the industries, and government agencies - not only from MOE, but also representatives from the polys, ITE and universities and also from EDB, SPRING and WDA.</p><p>We are also actively engaging all the stakeholders - the students, alumni, parents, teachers, and the industry players.</p><p>In conclusion on this topic, let me introduce, or launch the ASPIRE logo. We wanted a logo to reflect what ASPIRE stands for. Initially MOE embarked on doing it in-house. Then we realised - no, this is for the students, so the logo should come from them because they are the best people to express what they think and feel about it.</p><p>So we had an open competition across all the polys and ITE. There were close to 400 entries. The winner, Loh Jun Jie, a 3rd year student doing a diploma in Visual Communications at NYP, produced this.</p><p>This is his winning entry. As you can see, it is very professionally done. It is a reflection of the creativity and artistic talent of our poly students. And it is an example of the promise and potential of our poly and ITE students. We want to bring out the best in each and every one of them, and give them as many opportunities as possible to succeed. </p><p>This is what ASPIRE aspires to do.</p><h4>Preschool Education</h4><p>I move on now to preschool education. Bringing out the best in every child at every stage of the learning journey, and that journey begins at preschool. Much of a child&#8217;s development is influenced by their learning, exposure and experiences in their early years.</p><p>That&#8217;s why we put in a lot of effort and resources to uplift the quality of pre-school education, including:</p><ul><li>The quality of pre-school teachers;</li><li>The pre-school curriculum; and</li><li>The pre-school pedagogy.</li></ul><p>Even as we improve the quality, we are mindful that pre-school education should continue to be accessible and affordable to all. And that is why MOE has set up the MOE Kindergartens (MKs).</p><h4>MOE Kindergartens (MKs)</h4><p>The first five pilot MKs started their first batch of K1 classes in Jan 2014. All of them are progressing well. I visited the MOE Kindergarten in Punggol View Primary School.</p><p>Although it only started in January this year, the teachers and children at the school have already initiated collaborations with kindergarten teachers and students. For the Lunar New Year celebrations, the Primary 2 students and kindergarten children worked together to make greeting cards for the community. Through that interaction, the older students learnt values such as responsibility and care for their younger peers while the kindergarten children learnt teamwork through the activity. The children then gave the cards to the homes in the neighbourhood, which helped them to start thinking in terms of being part of a community.</p><p>As announced last week, five more MKs will commence operations in 2015. Four will be located in primary schools. So we can have a diversity of sites, which allows us to try different things and compare the pros and cons. One of them will be located within a community site in Yishun.</p><p>These five kindergartens will also have care services, because we understand the need of working parents, and we will continue to pilot innovative approaches to teaching and learning. </p><p>We will also continue to reserve a third of the places at these kindergartens for low-income families, and provide subsidies. So, every child in pre-school will have access to the opportunities afforded through education, irrespective of their financial background.</p><h4>Pre-School Curriculum</h4><p>The curriculum, teaching and learning resources in MKs are based on the belief and principles reflected in the refreshed Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) Framework for a quality kindergarten curriculum.</p><p>MOE&#8217;s underlying philosophy is about teaching children to learn, and to discover the joy of learning. The MKs offer a curriculum with a distinct Singapore flavour to allow children to learn in an authentic context.</p><p>So, for example, the HI-Light Programme supports holistic development of children in six learning areas: </p><ul><li>Aesthetics and Creative Expression;</li><li>Discovery of the World;</li><li>Language and Literacy;</li><li>Motor Skills Development;</li><li>Numeracy; and</li><li>Social and Emotional Development.</li></ul><p>Children explore, discover and make sense of the world around them through these themes. And the themes include: </p><ul><li>Topics familiar to children, allowing them to explore and learn about themselves and their friends; and</li><li>People and places around them.</li></ul><p>Dr Intan asked about centralisation of training for pre-school teachers. Raising the quality of teaching in pre-school centres is something that MOE remains committed to.</p><p>ECDA was formed to integrate the Government&#8217;s approach towards early childhood care and education in Singapore. We have raised the minimum qualifications for kindergarten-level teachers over the years. For existing teachers, ECDA will provide more professional development opportunities as part of the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Masterplan launched last year.</p><p>We have stepped up efforts to ensure consistency in the quality of such training with the enhancement of the accreditation system and standards that training providers must adhere to. Our immediate priority is to strengthen the polytechnic training pipeline by increasing intake numbers to meet the increased manpower demands. As these are the more immediate needs, we will focus on them first. We will study the feasibility of centralising pre-service training when manpower demand has stabilised.</p><h4>A Broad-Based Education</h4><p>Ms Faizah Jamal asked about eco-literacy in our schools. Our children are exposed to eco-literacy throughout their education from preschool, all the way up to the IHLs.</p><p>Pre-school children are exposed through the &#8220;Discovery of the World&#8221; mentioned earlier. In our primary and secondary schools, eco-literacy is taught in two ways. It can be infused as part of other subjects, for example, Character and Citizenship Education, Social Studies, Science and Geography. In some schools, it is taught as distinctive programmes with partners such as the Science Centre Singapore (SCS). One such example is Balestier Hill Secondary, which has a programme titled: &#8220;Man and the Environment: Developing 21st Century Competencies through Environmental Education&#8221;.</p><p>Many schools also promote environmental education through co-curricular activities or school programmes, for example, Environmental Clubs or school-wide recycling efforts.</p><p>Ms Janice Koh asked about using drama as pedagogy. There are many pedagogies that teachers can use in their teaching, including drama. The choice of pedagogy depends on whether the subject lends itself to being taught in a particular way. I would like to assure her that MOE is supportive of this, not just of drama, but music as well. We have training support in drama through the Programme for Active Learning (PAL); increased recruitment of art and music teachers; a dedicated academy for arts teachers; funding for an art and music instructor scheme; and an art and music equipment grant for primary schools.</p><p>Also from 2014, the Singapore Teachers&#8217; Academy of the aRts (STAR) will be providing professional learning opportunities for drama teachers through two schemes: the Artist-Mentor Scheme; and the Arts Pedagogical Research Fund.</p><p>Drama teachers will also be able to work with established drama practitioners as mentors to enhance the teaching and learning of drama. </p><p>Mr Eugene Tan asked about efforts to promote the study of Asia. Today, there is already a significant focus on the study of our immediate regional environment in our schools at all levels. It is done through subjects like History and Social Studies. </p><p>The history and culture of China, India, and Southeast Asian countries and the development of ASEAN are covered in Social Studies for Primary, History and Social Studies for Secondary, and for History at Pre-university level..In our polys and ITE, there are numerous avenues to deepen understanding of Asia: there is China studies, with an attachment in China or world issues modules. And our Autonomous Universities (AUs) also have undergrad programmes and modules which give students a better understanding of the region. For example, NUS has an undergraduate programme in Southeast Asian Studies, and offers modules which look at regional politics. MOE also provides support to schools through the Trips for International Experience grant, allowing schools to organise meaningful overseas learning journeys in the region.</p><p>Mr Png Eng Huat asked about tuition grants for international students. The honourable member has raised this topic before in Parliamentary questions. And as the Minister had explained, eight out of 10 start serving the bond promptly, or have been granted approval by MOE to defer their service obligations to pursue further studies. The remaining ones are not necessarily automatically in default - some are overseas for further studies, but omitted to get approval, and some are seeking employment. It is not necessary for me to go into detail, as the Minister had answered that in the PQs previously. But one thing I can assure Mr Png of is, if it comes to MOE&#8217;s attention that there is a deliberate default, then enforcement action will be taken. </p><p>In response to Prof Eugene Tan, I would like to assure him that we are investing heavily in promoting scholarship on Singapore, and there is no lack of financial support for scholarship projects on Singapore. The amount of funding available is actually in excess of the number of quality projects submitted. I believe his concern is whether or not people will submit such projects. But we are of course happy to encourage the submission of projects with research on Singapore.</p><p>Prof Eugene Tan also asked about the Discretionary Admission Scheme (DAS) to AUs, of which he felt that 10% was too high. This was actually in response to a call for some flexibility, and being autonomous, the AUs are responsible for admissions into their institutions. They are expected, however, to maintain high standards in its admissions process and they are also accountable to their Boards. </p><p>Mr Yee Jenn Jong suggested that we could provide our NSMen with greater support for tertiary studies. Our universities have already been supporting their transition from NS back into their studies at a comfortable pace. At the NUS, NTU, and SMU, NSMen can choose to undergo a Special Term to take modules one semester earlier. If they complete sufficient modules during the Special Term, these students will be able to graduate a semester early.</p><p>NUS is also piloting an online course for NSMen to start their lessons prior to matriculation. Our NSMen will also have other options for further education, such as the specialist and advanced diploma programmes offered by our polytechnics. To the extent that his suggestion was for them to do part time studies in the course of their national service, I think it is important that they should, during the course of NS, focus and give all their energies and time to NS as it is very important. But if there are other things that can be done during the course of NS, I recommend that these suggestions can be referred to MINDEF. </p><p>So in conclusion, Mr Chairman, let me say that the efforts that we take are all designed to bring out the best in our children. We want the best for them because Singaporeans have great potential. MOE&#8217;s task is to make sure that that potential is realised.

Mr R Dhinakaran asked about Tamil Language (TL) provision in our secondary schools. At the secondary level, about 95% of Tamil Language students are able to study the language in their schools during curriculum time. The remaining students attend Tamil lessons outside curriculum time at one of the twelve geographically-distributed MOE TL centres. We will work with schools to ensure that students who travel for their Tamil Language lessons do not miss out on support programmes offered to their peers outside of curriculum time. We will also continue to regularly review the provision of Tamil Language instruction.</p><p>Most of our Tamil Language teachers are locally-trained. We assure Mr. R Dhinakaran that we give due regard to the UniSIM BA degree in Tamil Language, which is one of our key sources of prospective Tamil Language teachers. In fact, MOE actively reaches out to recruit UniSIM BA(TL) graduates who have displayed interest to teach the Tamil Language. Generally, UniSIM BA (TL) degree holders are eligible for placement on the salary scale for graduates. </p><p>MOE also works closely with the community to promote the official MTLs in, and beyond, our schools. As I have mentioned in Mandarin, we would be happy to work with partners like businesses, to expose young students to enterprises&#8217; need to recruit students with a high level of command of MTL. </p><p>Another way we work with the community to support the MTLs is through the Mother Tongue Language Learning Promotion Committees (MTLLPCs). These committees engage and harness the wisdom of our community stakeholders to organise programmes and activities that develop talent, and spark interest, in the MTLs, beyond classroom learning. An example is the national Malay debate competition (Bahas Empat PM), organised by Empat PM (the Malay Youth Literary Association), and funded by the Malay Language Learning Promotion Committee (MLLPC).</p><p>Sir, I hope to have given some reassurance to stakeholders of all three mother tongue languages that MOE is indeed very much committed to work together with the community to raise our students&#8217; interest in mother tongue languages. </p><h4>Bringing out the best in every child - More support for students with special education needs</h4><p>I will now talk about our commitment to develop an inclusive education system that helps each child to be the best that he or she can be - to achieve success in different ways, at different paces, and in different domains.</p><p>Our education system has not stood still. We have come a long way in our efforts to diversify how we teach and what we teach our students, and also in the additional support that we provide students with more specific needs, such as learning needs. Even as we acknowledge that more can be done in various areas, let us take stock of what we have achieved in a relatively short period of time. </p><p>We have different pathways and niche programmes that cater to various types of talents and interests. Some take the form of elective programmes such as for art, language, and music. For others, we take a whole-school approach, such as Singapore Sports School, and School of the Arts. All these provide avenues to develop the diverse talents of our students. </p><p>The introduction of Applied Learning Programmes and Lifelong Learning Programmes in our secondary schools also provides more opportunities for our students to excel in niche areas. </p><p>To meet specific learning needs of students who need more support, we have set up the Northlight School, Assumption Pathway School, Crest Secondary School and Spectra Secondary School. We have also rolled out levelling up programmes in our primary schools to build a strong foundation in literacy and numeracy in all students.</p><p>At the school and classroom level, our teachers have been trained to adjust their pedagogy to fit the profile and learning needs of their students. </p><p>To support low-progress learners better, MOE has established the Educational Support Branch to help teachers identify, adapt, and share teaching strategies to cater to the needs of this group of students, including using specific pedagogical strategies that help build the learners&#8217; self-belief and self-esteem.</p><p>For students with special needs, since 2005, all teachers learn about basic support for special needs during their pre-service training. On top of that, we have trained more than 3000 teachers as &#8220;Teachers trained in Special Needs&#8221; (TSNs), who have a deeper understanding of special needs. We will continue to train even more TSNs, who can share their expertise and support their colleagues in school. </p><p>Furthermore, we have recruited almost 400 Allied Educators specialising in Learning and Behavioural Support (AED(LBS)) for our primary and secondary schools, and will increase these numbers. All primary schools now have at least one AED(LBS), who provide more specialised support for students with dyslexia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and mild autism.</p><p>MOE also provides assistive learning devices for students with sensory and physical impairment, and these devices include FM equipment, Braille notebooks, computer systems and more. </p><p>Our schools are further supported by MOE psychologists who provide consultation and advice to school personnel on the identification and support for students with special needs. </p><p>At the same time, we value our VWO partners who have deep expertise in special needs, and who work with us to provide school-based itinerant support for students with physical and sensory impairment.</p><p>We thank the Member for his valuable feedback - I think what he has shared in terms of observations and feedback of parents echoes much of the feedback that we have heard through the Our Singapore Conversation (OSC) sessions organised nationally and also organised by the Ministry of Education. What we have heard over the months has triggered ideas as well as internal reviews within MOE, and we will continue to work to improve our system to support all types of special needs, together with our committed stakeholders.</p><p>I have updated on the support that our mainstream schools provide for our students with special needs, as requested by Ms Denise Phua during her cut just now. I hope it is clear in response to the points made by both Ms Phua and Mr Laurence Lien that our system has made significant moves to support our students with special needs, and that our pedagogies have become more varied. </p><p>We continue on this journey to bring out the best in every child, in every domain of learning, in every school, and in every stage of the education journey. </p><p>Let me now share more about what we intend to do for students with dyslexia. </p><p>Students with dyslexia form the largest group of students in our mainstream schools with special educational needs. They have a very good chance of catching up if intervention occurs early. </p><p>This is why MOE has piloted the School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) Programme since 2012. </p><p>The SDR Programme is a two-year specialised intervention programme for P3 and P4 students, conducted in small groups by trained school personnel, including AED(LBS) and TSNs. The remediation curriculum and strategies are designed by MOE reading specialists, and also include a home support component so that parents can play a role in consolidating the support provided by our schools. </p><p>One heartening success story of the SDR Programme is Muhammad Firdaus from Yio Chu Kang Primary School. Firdaus used to get upset and cry when he realised that his reading and spelling competencies were not on par with his peers. Thankfully, the SDR programme introduced Firdaus to various intervention strategies. After being on the programme for a year, his Allied Educator, Ms Siti Adliana noticed that his reading speed increased significantly from 20 to 100 words per minute. Beyond improving his reading and language competencies, the SDR programme boosted Firdaus&#8217; self-confidence. Today, the once-demoralised boy organises study groups to help and encourage his peers. </p><p>Having seen how the programme has helped students to learn to read and grow in confidence, MOE has expanded the SDR programme to another 20 schools this year, bringing the total number of schools with the programme to one third of our primary schools. This brings the total number of students benefitting from the SDR to close to 1000.</p><p>We are committed to providing more support to our students with dyslexia, and aim to roll the programme out to more schools in the near term. At the same time, we need to build the capacity to train, monitor and support school staff who deliver the programme, so that the quality of the programme is kept consistently high. </p><h4>Support for our students with special needs in our IHLs</h4><p>Over the years, more of our students, both those from mainstream schools as well as those from Special Education (SPED) schools, have progressed to our institutes of higher learning (IHLs). </p><p>Their success in gaining admissions to the IHLs should be celebrated. </p><p>The next step we are taking is to provide students with special needs with more structured support in their education journey in the IHLs. Some members particularly Mr Ang Wei Neng, Ms Denise Phua asked about this at previous COS debates too. We have heard you. </p><p>Ms Denise Phua asked for an update on the setting up of Disability Support Offices in our IHLs, and we will give a more comprehensive update today.</p><p>Before that I want to thank Ms Phua for her unstinting work in this sector. With her advice and support, we have been reaching out to students with special needs in the IHLs. This has been very helpful in clarifying our thinking, and in helping us to identify what needs to be done. </p><p>Our stakeholders have come together to create the overarching vision for students with special needs in our IHLs, which is: &#8220;To develop an inclusive community that promotes a culture of openness, understanding, and mutual support in our IHLs, so that students with special education needs can have a holistic education experience, attain independent living skills, and be equipped to access meaningful employment upon graduation.&#8221; </p><p>As part of this broader IHL vision for special needs support, we have two specific initiatives that will start this year. </p><p>Through dialogue sessions, we have affirmed our students&#8217; and other stakeholders&#8217; desire for a one-stop office that provides disability support. </p><p>An illustration of how such an office might work is the &#8220;Learning Accessibility Office (LAO)&#8221;, located within Student Care Centres in the ITE colleges. This is a one-stop office for ITE students with physical, learning and behavioural disabilities to seek advice and assistance. The ITE set up not only ensure that the students with special needs have a point of contact from admission to graduation, they also provide pre-admission help by ensuring the school report forms of these students are obtained from their Secondary Schools, to ensure a smooth transition to ITE. This helps to provide special needs support in a more structured, systematic, and sustainable manner for their students. </p><p>Starting this year, therefore, each publicly-funded university, polytechnic, ITE College and the arts institutions (in other words NAFA and LASALLE) will set up a Disability Support Office on campus, to provide one-stop support for students with special education needs. They will also set up a disability support website to provide information on the special needs support available in their institutions. </p><p>These offices will coordinate training on special needs support for their staff, and work with course managers to ensure that necessary adjustments are made for students with special needs so that they are able to access lessons, tests and exams. </p><p>Assistive Devices (such as FM devices, text-to-speech software) and support services (such as signing interpretation services) are essential to help students with special needs gain equal access to their institutions&#8217; programmes, so that they can participate fully in, and benefit from, their school experience. </p><p>Chia Hong Sen is currently a first-year student in Temasek Polytechnic (TP). Despite his visual impairment, he is able to participate fully in his Diploma in IT) course. His notes are provided in softcopy format so that he can access them via the text-to-speech Smart Reader. During the examination period, he is allowed to use a laptop equipped with text-to-speech software, so that he can hear the questions, and type his answers in. Being a positive and hardworking student, and with the help of assistive devices and support services, Hong Sen has overcome many challenges and adapted well in his polytechnic.</p><p>To benefit more students like Hong Sen, MOE will set up a dedicated Special Education Needs (SEN) Fund for Polytechnics and ITE students with physical or sensory-related impairment. </p><p>The Disability Support Offices will administer requests for financial support from this new SEN fund. Under this fund, students can receive up to $5000 to purchase assistive devices to alleviate physical impairment, such as word prediction equipment, voice recognition technology, computer pointing devices etc. Up to $25,000 per student will be made available for students who require supporting services such as interpretation in sign language. </p><p>This means that seamless financial support for assistive technology will be available to students with special needs from schools through to ITE and the polytechnics. The universities and arts institutions are also committed to ensuring that the same support is provided to their students. </p><h4>Special Education (SPED)</h4><p>In my speech last year, I spoke about the Government&#8217;s continued commitment in uplifting the quality, accessibility, and affordability of our Special Education (SPED) sector. </p><p>Some of the initiatives from the last few years have helped to contribute in raising the quality of education. </p><p>For example, SPED schools have been able to tap on the $4.5mil Tote Board ICT Fund for innovative infusion of ICT in their teaching. Other initiatives, such as the SPED curriculum framework and the formation of professional learning teams in all schools, have helped to uplift the quality of what is taught in SPED schools. </p><p>The enhanced Opportunity Fund announced last year has also helped to enrich the learning of SPED students from lower income backgrounds. </p><p>Ms Denise Phua has asked the Government to consider having features of the Anchor Operator (AOP) Scheme in the SPED sector. </p><p>Sir, the Anchor Operator scheme was introduced for pre-school operators to provide funding support to eligible operators to scale up the provision of good quality and affordable early childhood care and education services. </p><p>As I have mentioned, quality and affordability are also two key areas of focus for MOE&#8217;s work in the SPED sector. Currently, our 20 VWO-run SPED schools are funded by MOE and NCSS. Our funding to SPED schools has also increased over time. This tripartite partnership between VWOs, MOE and NCSS recognises the VWOs&#8217; long history, community links, capability and expertise that allow them to customise their programmes and services to meet the needs of SPED students, and to help these students with post-school transitions. </p><p>We continue to work closely together, focusing on the quality and affordability of SPED, and to ensure sufficient capacity in the sector.</p><p>Sir although the AOP scheme was set up in quite a different context from SPED, I find the member&#8217;s proposal intriguing, seeing as it is underpinned by her concerns for student outcomes and quality education, which MOE shares.</p><p>We will study the Member&#8217;s proposal. </p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>The Government has been doing more to ensure that we continue to be a society that gives hope and assurance to all. </p><p>DPM recently announced transport subsidies to help persons with disabilities gain access to essential services, like care, work, and education. We are glad that our students with special needs will also benefit.</p><p>MSF will also provide a fuller report on the related initiatives for persons with disabilities, under the Enabling Masterplan 2 (EM2).</p><p>But the government cannot do it all. I wish to thank the community, businesses, our educators and all who work hard to build an inclusive society.</p><p>MOE will continue to work with MSF, NCSS, our VWOs, and other partners to embrace people with special needs as full and integral members of our Singapore society.</p> http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/singapore-education/media/~3/nRYX5tTpTJk/fy-2014-committee-of-supply-third-reply-by-mos-sim-ann.php http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/speeches/2014/03/07/fy-2014-committee-of-supply-third-reply-by-mos-sim-ann.php key Fri, 07 Mar 2014 23:05:00 +0800 http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/speeches/2014/03/07/fy-2014-committee-of-supply-third-reply-by-mos-sim-ann.php FY 2014 Committee of Supply Debate: 4th Reply by Mr Hawazi Daipi <p>Mdm Chairperson, the Minister had spoken about our commitment to bring out the best in every child, in every domain of learning, in every school, at every stage of the learning journey, whatever the starting point to create a better future together. This can only be achieved through a close partnership of school, home and the community. I will speak about how good efforts enabled by this partnership have benefitted our children.</p><h4>Parents as a Key Partner for Holistic Education</h4><p>Parents, being the first caregivers and teachers, are no doubt a key influence on the holistic development of their child. To thrive in the 21st Century, there has been an increased premium placed on softer competencies like attitudes, values, and life skills. These softer competencies complement a rigorous academic curriculum to help our students navigate an increasingly ambiguous and fast-changing workplace. Hence, we are heartened to see parents sharing this vision and working hand in hand with schools in providing a conducive environment to develop the whole child.</p><p>Co-chairing the National Advisory Council known as COMmunity and PArents in Support of Schools (COMPASS), I am pleased to share the many platforms that MOE has put in place to engage a wide spectrum of parents deeply and meaningfully. An example is the COMPASS Forum Theatre, an interactive drama to spark off discussions on parenting styles through the role-playing of different parent-child scenarios. I was at the first session and was pleased to see parents, young people, as well as educationists in the audience, participating actively and co-creating parenting solutions. We found that such an activity helps parents reflect on their role and parenting style.</p><p>Mdm Helen Su participated in one of these sessions with her son. She shared that the event had improved her relationship with her son as both of them walked away with a better understanding of parents&#8217; and teenagers&#8217; mindsets. She also hoped to attend more of such sessions to guide her through the growing process of her teenage son.</p><p>Parent Support Groups (PSGs) also contribute very directly towards our children&#8217;s well-roundedness. The PSG members of Jurong Primary School believe strongly that learning is a wonderful adventure which parents can be a part of. For example, they work closely with the school in conducting homeskills programmes to teach students basic cooking and sewing. As Ms Denise Phua pointed out, having these living skills help our children develop independence and become well-adjusted adults in future. </p><p>Mdm Ivy Seah, who chaired the PSG in Cedar Primary School, believes that the ethnic diversity of the PSG can greatly enrich the National Education curriculum and cultural programmes. Comprising parents of ethnicities and nationalities, Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans, the PSG exposes the students to a range of Asian cultures, through displays and sharing during cultural celebrations, as well as experiential learning programmes. These are parents from India, Nepal, China and some other countries, who come together with Singaporean parents to help the children learn better and to understand diversity and accept it.</p><p>In Woodgrove Secondary School, the PSG members are actively involved in Values-in-Action (VIA) projects as the parents believe that they should lead by example in contributing to the society. During a visit to the Sunshine Welfare Action Mission (SWAMI), the PSG members performed and played games with the elderly. Students witnessed their parents&#8217; care for the elderly, while learning to be more empathetic towards the old folks.</p><p>PSGs could also play a role in family bonding. Mr Edwin Cheng, who used to be a part of the PSG of Ai Tong School, feels that the regular family-wide participation in PSG activities has helped his children adjust well to school and develop a sense of belonging.</p><p>It is encouraging to see more parents coming forth to play a more active role in their child&#8217;s education. We recognise the value of PSGs and support their meaningful activities. In 2012, we introduced the PSG Fund, which is a seed funding of $2,500 per school to enhance partnership efforts with parents. </p><p>For example, this fund had supported East Spring Secondary School in achieving a common understanding between parents and the school. As a member of the PSG EXCO, Mrs Esther Sim was involved in strategising with the school on how best to use the PSG fund. The result was a PSG Handbook to help parents understand the school mission, and what they can do as partners in education. </p><p>This fund also enabled the PSG of Park View Primary School Fund to organise workshops to promote networking and sharing of knowledge amongst parents. So, it is not just a fund that parents use to benefit the children, but they also use this fund to enrich themselves through sharing. One such workshop was on &#8220;Celebrating a Pro-Family Mindset&#8221;, during which parents had the opportunities to reflect, and devise strategies on living and celebrating a family life that they envision. Participants provided feedback that they have acquired new skills and had become more confident in coaching their child.</p><p>To support partnership with parents on an on-going basis, MOE will provide each school with an annual top up of their PSG Fund of up to $2,500 per year. I hope that this will sustain the momentum of the good programmes we have today, while enabling more parents to play a more active role in their child&#8217;s education.</p><p>I am also pleased to share that COMPASS is working closely with a group of PSG leaders from various schools to organise the first ever PSG conference, which will be held in April this year at the MOE&#8217;s ExCEL Fest 2014. The conference will allow PSGs to share their best practices with one another, and grow together. </p><p>Dr Lily Neo spoke about bullying. MOE acknowledges her concerns and takes a zero-tolerance approach towards school bullying. </p><p>The new Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum empowers students to help themselves and support their peers who are bullied. Teachers are also equipped with customised resources to identify and manage bullying cases. Through our curriculum and programmes, schools impart values to foster appropriate behaviour and inculcate socio-emotional competencies to help students respond in challenging situations. Families, particularly parents, are our best partners in reinforcing these values and competencies at home.</p><p>Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap spoke about re-introducing Religious Knowledge into our curriculum. Our curriculum today provides our students with a broad-based exposure of major religions in Singapore. Such exposure helps to promote respect between people of different religious backgrounds. Many schools also leverage special occasions such as Deepavali, Good Friday and Racial Harmony Day to help students appreciate our multicultural and multi-religious Singapore. Hence, with the wide range of efforts, it is not necessary to re-introduce Religious Knowledge as a separate subject. </p><p>I agree with Assoc Prof Eugene Tan on the need to preserve the character and integrity of mission and faith-affiliated school. These schools have a well-established heritage that gives them a distinctive identity and contributes to diversity in our educational landscape. Parents who choose to enrol their children in these schools generally appreciate the unique heritage and ethos of the school. </p><p>In order to preserve the common space where our young can develop a shared Singaporean identity, MOE has set guidelines to ensure that schools conduct religious activities sensitively. Within these guidelines, we want these schools to maintain these traditions and school culture, which is part-and-parcel of embracing our multi-religious Singapore. </p><p>Parents are important role models for our students to understand, respect and celebrate such diversity. This is an important part of holistic education, and goes towards fostering social cohesion in Singapore. </p><h4>Community Provides an Authentic Learning Environment Beyond the Classroom</h4><p>Authentic learning opportunities go beyond the four walls of the classroom. The Minister has spoken about how the Applied Learning Programme connects academic knowledge and skills with the real world, so that students can appreciate the relevance and value of what they are learning.</p><p>Outram Secondary School has been making use of various teaching approaches to sustain students&#8217; interest in the learning of Malay Language and culture. For instance, the school conducted Silat lessons, which allowed students to learn more about the traditional Malay martial arts and the different Malay words used in the martial arts. In collaboration with the community, the students put up Silat performances for the senior citizens at the Beo Crescent neighbourhood. A Malay Language teacher, Miss Elyani Mohamed, commented that through these activities, students were able to gain appreciation of the Malay culture and traditions as well as learn important values to develop their character. </p><p>Ahmad Ibrahim Primary School partnered with the Singapore Chinese Physicians&#8217; Association and co-created an innovative pedagogy for the learning and teaching of Mother Tongue Languages using Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The upper Primary School students who took Chinese Language visited and interviewed Chinese physicians in the neighbourhood on their work and the different types of TCM treatments. The students then carried out further research by referring to the TCM reference books found in the school&#8217;s TCM room, which was designed like a Chinese Physician&#8217;s clinic and served as an authentic learning centre for their students. They also had the opportunity to tour the Singapore Chung Hwa Medical Institution which was the school&#8217;s community partner to see the Chinese physicians in action. This partnership provided the platform for students to hone their Chinese Language through experiential, self-directed learning.</p><p>Partnership with the community also presents endless opportunities to enhance our Character and Citizenship Education, which involves opening the mind and touching the heart of our children. Beyond the theoretical transmission of values, we must also help our children translate these values into action and make a difference to Singapore and the lives of fellow Singaporeans. </p><p>Marsiling Community Centre launched Homework Cafe in the beginning of this year to foster to provide a conducive environment for children from disadvantaged families to do their homework. To date, the programme has benefitted 20 children from families receiving public financial assistance. Since the start of the programme, students from Republic Polytechnic (RP) have regularly volunteered to coach and help these children with their homework. Seeing these children eager to come for Homework Cafe, Aqeem, one of the RP students who has been volunteering in the last six weeks, derives a deep sense of satisfaction from having played a part in levelling up his community.</p><h4>Engaging and Co-creating with our Partners</h4><p>Our Singapore Conversation (OSC) in 2013 drove home the importance of listening closely to our stakeholders&#8217; needs and aspirations, and factoring these into our policymaking and implementation. MOE will continue to reach out and engage parents, our community partners and stakeholders extensively and meaningfully. Consolidating our experience from OSC, we are developing deeper engagement capacity among HQ and school personnel. </p><p>I thank Ms Denise Phua for sharing her concerns and interest regarding parent engagement at the school level. This is indeed, as I said earlier in my speech, a very important part of the school and community work. I hope that the earlier part of my speech has demonstrated that our schools are forthcoming in engaging parents. This can be seen from the fact that more than 95% of our schools have formalised PSGs. Besides that, our schools have always been communicating regularly with parents through various channels, including emails, meet-the-parents sessions, newsletters and school websites. </p><p>I agree with Ms Phua that effective parent engagement requires schools to have a deep understanding of parents&#8217; concerns and this will form the foundation of mutual trust between parents and schools. In order to support and sustain schools in their stakeholder engagement efforts, MOE has produced and disseminated a Facilitation Primer, this publication [indicating a book in his hands], which is a toolkit on effective facilitation. It is our aim that through better engagement with stakeholders, MOE will be better able to co-create the future education system with our stakeholders.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Madam, summing up, parents and the community have a huge role to play, whether in inculcating the right values in our children, teaching our children to embrace diversity in our multicultural, multi-religious Singapore, or helping our children learn beyond the classroom. To bring out the best in every child, we are committed to continue harnessing the energy of parents and the community, to live out MOE&#8217;s Partnership motto &#8220;Building on Trust, Partnership as One&#8221;. </p><p>Madam, let me conclude my speech in Malay:<br><br>Pemerintah berazam untuk membantu setiap pelajar mencapai keupayaan masing-masing yang terbaik, dalam setiap bidang pembelajaran, di setiap sekolah, di setiap peringkat persekolahan, biar apa sahaja latar belakang sosial mereka, untuk membina masa depan yang lebih baik bagi setiap pelajar dan negara. Ibu bapa dan masyarakat mempunyai peranan yang sangat penting untuk membantu menanam nilai-nilai yang baik yang ingin kita kembangkan di kalangan pelajar kita demi masa depan anak-anak kita. Kementerian Pendidikan akan terus membantu sekolah membina keupayaan untuk bekerjasama dengan ibu bapa dan masyarakat untuk memastikan para pelajar kita akan dapat belajar dalam suasana yang lebih luas, di luar jangkauan bilik darjah. </p> http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/singapore-education/media/~3/-16wiebbrxs/fy-2014-committee-of-supply-debate-4th-reply-by-mr-hawazi-daipi.php http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/speeches/2014/03/07/fy-2014-committee-of-supply-debate-4th-reply-by-mr-hawazi-daipi.php key Fri, 07 Mar 2014 23:04:00 +0800 http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/speeches/2014/03/07/fy-2014-committee-of-supply-debate-4th-reply-by-mr-hawazi-daipi.php Stronger Partnerships To Support Access To Opportunities In Schools <p>To better support our students to access opportunities in schools, the Ministry of Education (MOE) will be strengthening our partnership with parents and the community via the school-based student care centres, the school-based dyslexia remediation programme and collaborations with Parent Support Groups (PSGs). </p><h6>Partnerships with Student Care Centre (SCC) service providers</h6><p>MOE will be working in partnership with SCC service providers to <strong>expand school-based SCCs to 40 more primary schools over the next two years,</strong> covering a total of 120 primary schools or close to two-thirds of all primary schools. The 40 additional school-based SCCs are expected to benefit another 2,500 students, on top of the existing 7,500 students enrolled today in school-based SCCs. </p><p>School-based SCCs provide an important support for students, especially those who could benefit from a structured and supportive environment in after school care, and particularly where parents are both working. </p><p>MOE will continue to support schools to strengthen the collaboration with SCC service providers, and to improve the quality, accessibility and affordability of school-based SCCs. Please refer to <a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/annex-a-stronger-partnerships-to-support-access-to-schools.pdf">Annex A</a> for the list of schools with school-based SCCs as of 2014, and the schools with plans to set up school-based SCCs in 2014. </p><h6>Partnerships with parents to support School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR)</h6><p>MOE has further <strong>expanded the School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) programme to 20 more primary schools in 2014</strong>, to now cover a total of 62 primary schools or close to a third of all primary schools. Another 180 students are expected to benefit in the additional 20 primary schools. This is on top of the existing 810 students already supported in the existing 42 primary schools.</p><p>The SDR programme is a two-year intervention for Primary Three and Four students who are identified through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of Primary Two. As part of the SDR programme, materials were created to partner parents to enhance the support for their children with dyslexia. For example, schools engaged parents by updating parents regularly on their children&#8217;s learning progress using the progress monitoring booklet. Parents are encouraged to use the reading booklets provided for the school holidays to practise reading with their children and work on literacy activities to ensure continued support. </p><p>Interim findings from the two-year pilot in 2012 and 2013 showed that students who had participated in the SDR programme had improved in their reading and spelling skills. Their teachers observed that the students grew in confidence and were more positive towards learning. The involvement of parents also had a positive impact on the students&#8217; achievements and attitudes towards the dyslexia remediation.</p><p>Please refer to <a href="http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/annex-b-stronger-partnerships-to-support-access-to-schools.pdf">Annex B</a> for the list of schools providing the SDR programme.</p><h6>Partnerships with parents in Parent Support Groups (PSGs)</h6><p>MOE will provide all schools with <strong>an annual top-up of their Parent Support Group (PSG) Fund of up to $2,500 per year</strong>, starting from 2014. </p><p>The PSG Fund aims to support schools in strengthening their parent engagement efforts, and to enhance the capacity of PSGs in supporting schools&#8217; holistic development of their students.</p><p>Since its launch in 2012 as a seed funding, the Fund has enabled schools to better engage parents and promote parent-child bonding by organising activities such as parent education workshops, school parent-engagement projects, and community projects. Encouraged by these, we want to support more such efforts.

This will cost the Government up to $147 million more per year. </p><p>To provide more structured and sustainable support to students with special educational needs in our IHLs, there will be a Disability Support Office (DSO) in each publicly-funded university, polytechnic, ITE college and arts institution<a href="#footnote-2" title="footnote2-anchor"><sup>2</sup></a>, from this year. MOE will also set up a Special Education Needs (SEN) Fund to help ITE and polytechnic students with physical, hearing or visual impairment to better access a good post-secondary education. The universities and arts institutions are also committed to ensuring that the same support is provided to their students. </p><p>These enhancements are part of MOE&#8217;s resolve to support all Singaporeans to seize the opportunities offered in our IHLs. </p><h4>Enhanced IHL bursaries for students from the lower and middle income households</h4><h6>Revision of Income Eligibility Thresholds for Bursaries</h6><p>The income eligibility criteria for the government bursaries in IHLs will be revised upwards from AY2014. The income cut-off to qualify for these bursaries will be raised, in per capita income (PCI) terms, from $1,700 to $1,900 per month, thus broadening the pool of students who will qualify for the bursaries. Details of changes in the income criteria for each of the bursary tiers are provided in <u>Table 1.</u></p><p><img alt="table-1-revised-income-eligibility-criteria-ay2014.png" src="http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/table-1-revised-income-eligibility-criteria-ay2014.png" width="535" height="265" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p><h5>ITE Students</h5><p>The four tiers of bursaries for ITE students (two tiers under the CDC/CCC Bursary and two tiers under the MOE Bursary<a href="#footnote-3" title="footnote3-anchor"><sup>3</sup></a>, ) will remain. From AY2014, the bursary quanta for all tiers will be raised by between $90 and $200. The bursaries for ITE students from households with per capita income up to $950 will be significantly higher than their fees, helping them to also defray their living expenses.</p><p><img alt="diagram-1-bursary-enhancements-for-ite-students.png" src="http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/diagram-1-bursary-enhancements-for-ite-students.png" width="575" height="386" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p><h5>Diploma Students</h5><p>For diploma students, those from households with per capita income of up to $950 will receive $200 more through the CDC/CCC Bursary, with the bursary quantum being raised to $2,000 per year. This revised quantum will cover about 80% of polytechnic diploma tuition fees. Students from households with per capita income between $951 and $1,400 will receive $150 more through the MOE Tier 1 Bursary, up from the current $1,350 to $1,500 per year. This will cover 60% of the tuition fees. Those from households with per capita income between $1,401 and $1,900 will get $300 more through the MOE Tier 2 Bursary, up from the current $450 to $750 per year, which will cover about 30% of the tuition fees.</p><p><img alt="diagram-2-bursary-enhancements-for-diploma-students.png" src="http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/diagram-2-bursary-enhancements-for-diploma-students.png" width="578" height="366" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></p><h5>Undergraduates</h5><p>For undergraduates, the Government will increase the CDC/CCC Bursary quantum by $700, up from the current $2,900 to $3,600 per year for students from households with per capita income of up to $950. This will generally cover about 45% of university tuition fees. Undergraduates from households with per capita income between $951 and $1,400 will receive $450 more through the MOE Tier 1 Bursary, up from the current $2,150 to $2,600 per year.

All IHLs will also set up a disability support website to provide information on SEN support available.</p><p>The DSOs will work closely with MOE and Voluntary Welfare Organisations to enable students with SEN to receive support during their education in the IHLs. The DSO will coordinate training on SEN support for staff, and work with course managers to ensure that necessary adjustments are made for students with SEN to access lessons, tests and exams. The DSO will also administer requests for financial support from the new SEN Fund.</p><h6>SEN Fund</h6><p>Each polytechnic and ITE college will be able to tap on the SEN Fund, to help Singapore Citizen students with physical or sensory-related impairments purchase assistive technology devices and supporting services such as signing interpretation and Braille printing. Each institution can use up to $5,000 per student with physical impairment to purchase assistive technology devices. Up to $25,000 will be made available for each student with visual or hearing impairments to procure assistive technology devices and supporting services. </p><p>Sufficient funding will be set aside to ensure that eligible students are adequately supported for their educational needs throughout their education in the polytechnics and ITE. Students will be able to use these devices both during their duration of study, which may include internships, and after graduation. </p><p>Our publicly-funded universities and arts institutions will provide the same support to their students with SEN. </p><h5>Footnote</h5><ol class="footnote"><li id="footnote-1">Applicable to students taking publicly-funded courses in education institutions such as the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), polytechnics, arts institutions, and universities. <a href="#footnote1-anchor" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></li><li id="footnote-2">The two arts institutions are the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) and LASALLE College of the Arts. <a href="#footnote2-anchor" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></li><li id="footnote-3">The CDC/CCC Bursary Scheme provides financial assistance to Singapore Citizen students from households with gross monthly household per capita income of up to $950.

The intent is to promote holistic education by encouraging a broader definition of merit.</p><p>Generally, MOE expects that students admitted through DSA understand the commitment on their part to participate in the CCAs and activities related to the talent for which they were admitted. The intent is also for the DSA school to nurture these students further in their strengths. However, we also recognise that there might be a few cases where the DSA students may need to transfer out of their CCAs due to unforeseen reasons - for example due to sports injury. In such cases, schools will work with the student on a change in CCA for the educational interests of the student.</p><p>Over the past three years and on average, of the students admitted through DSA, about 95% are still in a CCA related to their DSA talent two years after their admission.</p> http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/singapore-education/media/~3/070ANw5TICA/direct-school-admission-cca.php http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/parliamentary-replies/2014/03/direct-school-admission-cca.php Mon, 03 Mar 2014 18:00:00 +0800 http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/parliamentary-replies/2014/03/direct-school-admission-cca.php
