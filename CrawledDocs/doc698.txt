IPSA-METU Summer School is be the first of its kind in Turkey, Middle East and North Africa as well as Eurasia. It provides a unique opportunity for the graduate students and early professionals studying and researching in social sciences to be trained by the most prominent experts on several research methods. The Summer School offers six courses on quantitative and qualitative methods and welcomes graduate students, early career academics and professionals interested in receiving theoretical and practical training in these methods. Due to the rigorous training and full time schedules of these courses the Summer School participants will choose and register to one of these six courses which will be given over a period of two weeks in week days, allowing participants to attend both lectures and practical sessions. The schedule will also include one-on-one sessions in the form of office hours providing the students a chance to review their individual projects with the instructors. Detailed course descriptions as well as short biographies of the instructors can be found on the website.

Teresa Sasinska-Klas's Lecture at the 1st IAPSS World Congress: Ukraine, Russia and the EU: New Communication Order or Disorder? The International Association for Political Science Students (IAPSS) welcomed IPSA's Vice-President for Europe and Africa, Prof. Teresa Sasinska-Klas, at the 1st IAPSS World Congress currently being held in Thessaloniki (Greece) from March 31 to April 6, 2014. Her lecture on April 1st, under the theme â€œUkraine, Russia and the EU: New Communication Order or Disorder?â€?, addressed one of the most recent and important topics in international politics and attracted many participants who later engaged in a lively debate. Prof Sasinska-Klas exposed the current political problems in Ukraine by giving a detailed historical overview of the region. Starting from the 18th century, she identified the main lines of historical conflicts and finally concluded with a precise analysis of the current political situation â€“ the causes and outcomes of the Maidan Movement, the Referendum and the Annexation of Crimea, and the confrontation between actors such as the United States, the European Union and Russia over security issues in the region. Because of  her wide knowledge of Western European, Russian and Ukrainian politics, she was able to identify the main causes of the Ukraine conflict from both the domestic and the international perspectives. The participants got insights in the manifold perceptions of the conflict, even those perceptions that are sometimes overlooked by political commentators and correspondents. Furthermore she presented a clear overview of the many obstacles which have to be overcome in order to understand the current challenge. The Question and Answers section that followed resulted in very lively and vivid discussions since participants from many regions of the World were present, including  Russian and Ukrainian students. Prof Sasinska-Klas took great care in answering all questions with ever more detailed information. She even stayed at the venue long after the lecture was over and kept discussing with participants whose interests were especially woken by her lecture. The 1st IAPSS World Congress being currently held until April 6, 2014 is proving  to be a great success, attracting over 250 participants from all continents. IPSA congratulates IAPSS on the event and looks forward to a continuous collaboration.   Don't miss the INM Symposium at WC2014 / Ne manquez pas le symposium de l'INM au prochain WC2014 - "Developing Expertise in the Design of Participatory Tools: Professionalization and Diversification of the Public Participation Field" The Institut du Nouveau Monde (INM) is a non-partisan organization whose mission is to increase citizen participation in democratic life.
