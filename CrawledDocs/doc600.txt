READ MORE » Podosome formation requires no cell-matrix traction force MBI’s Cheng-han Yu from the Sheetz group has shown that in the absence of traction forces, for example, on fluid substrates, fibroblasts form podosomes rather than focal adhesions. READ MORE » The Influence of Nanotopography on Stem Cell Differentiation Prof Yim highlights an important role of FAK in the mechano- transduction and differentiation of stem cells. READ MORE » Slowing down liver cancer MBI PI Low Boon Chuan’s lab has found switching on the Rho protein slows the growth of liver tumours by up to 30 percent. READ MORE » A breakthrough in wound healing Profs Lim and Ladoux have discovered how keratinocytes form “bridges” across damaged skin, even in areas devoid of a supporting extracellular matrix. READ MORE » Mechanical coupling between the actin cytoskeleton and the nucleus MBI PI Shivashankarâ€™s lab has showed that perinuclear apical actin can directly affect nuclear height and transmit force to chromatin.
