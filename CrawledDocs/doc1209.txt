He focuses largely on the silicon platform because he believes that this would be the first platform in which microphotonics is likely to make a big impact. Together with his collaborators at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, LNL Technologies, and the Institute of Microelectronics (Singapore), Dr Lim's achievements includes the development of the first integrated mode converter to couple light from optical fiber to sub-micron optical waveguides; the development of the smallest low-loss microbends and one of the smallest multi-channel demulitplexor at telecommunications wavelengths; and the attainment of the first <1dB/cm loss in high index contrast sub-micron optical waveguides at telecommunications wavelengths These research advances are likely to result in faster and cheaper computers as well as lower cost communications which, in turn, will make video-on-demand commercially viable. Dr Lim founded LNL Technologies to commercialize these technologies by making them fully compatible with IC fabrication. For his research on monolithically integrated photonic and optoelectronic chips for communications and computing applications, Dr Desmond Rodney Lim Chin Siong is awarded the Young Scientist Award 2003.   Related Information Our Research Community Honours & Accolades Scholars' Achievements   Resources News Visits Publications Photo and Video Gallery Quick Links --Select-- A*STAR Research Research Institutes Singapore Researchers Database A*STAR Resource Portal A*STAR Cloud Terms & Conditions  |  Privacy Statement |  Sitemap  | Rate Us Copyright 2009 Agency for Science, Technology and Research
