Part of this initiative is the five-module University Town curriculum that includes the Ideas and Exposition Programme (IEP). The IEP has been designed and constructed by staff members from the Centre for English Language Communication (CELC). Ideas and Exposition Programme CELC contributes two sets of modules to the U-Town curriculumâ€”Ideas and Exposition I (I&E I) for first year college residents and Ideas and Exposition II (I&E II) for second year college residents. Both sets of modules are: Content Specific Each I&E module focuses on a particular topic, with readings selected to be accessible to undergraduates. Although each topic reflects the concerns of a particular discipline, all modules introduce students to principles and strategies that will help them write throughout their academic careers. Rhetorically intensive Argumentation is the heart of academic expository writing; therefore each I&E module focuses on how to best construct evidence-based arguments that show readers why it is reasonable to problematize a previous analysis and resolve the problem in a particular way. The I&E I modules help students to produce expository writing that readers will recognize as increasing their understanding of a given topic while the I&E II modules will help students learn and apply five core strategies that underlie successful scholarly research and writing. I&E I and II classes are capped at 12 students each. Within this small group environment, students collaboratively negotiate alternative responses to problems they raise. Application Details I&E modules are for any university town student who says, "That's me," to one or more of the four statements below. I want to make more sense about ideas that make only partial sense to me. I want to work with ideas beyond those in my textbooks. I want other people to pay attention to my ideas. I don't have to write extended papers for most of my modules, but I still want to be able to write well. Pre-requisites Students must have been exempted from the NUS Qualifying English Test (QET) or have passed ES1000, Basic English and/or ES1102, English for Academic Purposes modules. Preclusions I&E I Modules Students who have already read a WP2201 or IEM module, ES1201G, ES1201L, ES1501A, ES1501B, ES1501C I&E II Modules Students who have already read an IEM2201 module Module Offerings I&E I Module Offerings Common Objectives All I&E modules help students to produce expository writing that readers will recognize as increasing their understanding of a given topic. These modules develop five sets of core strategies that underlie successful scholarly writing in the arts, humanities, social sciences, life sciences, physical sciences, and mathematics: Analyzing how authors problematize what other authors say and how they argue their responses to these problems, Entering the conversations between these authors by problematizing their arguments and arguing why one's problem and response are reasonable with available evidence, Organizing and wording ideas to help readers understand a line of reasoning, Documenting sources so readers can check one's use of other scholars' ideas, and Revising the content, wording, and organization of a paper, as well as surface features such as spelling, punctuation, etc. Paper Assignments Students write three papers in every I&E module. Writing Assignment 1: 600-word Reflective Summary This writing assignment asks students to (1) summarize an assigned/chosen reading and (2) reflect on ideas in the text that strike them as new and interesting.  The summary should provide the following information: Identify the reading's topic, Show how the reading uses its main claims/points to reach its conclusion(s), and Identify intended readers and the role that the reading's author hopes readers will play if they accept the conclusion(s). Writing Assignment 2: 800-word Comparative Paper This writing assignment asks students to reflect on ideas in a given body of literature that strike them as new and interesting. Students will choose two readings from the course pack, discuss how the information in the articles relates to each other, how they reinforce or call into question ideas or assertions, and how they suggest new ways of viewing the topic.: Writing Assignment 3: 1,500-word Expository Paper This writing assignment asks students to (1) formulate an as-yet unresolved research problem on a chosen/assigned topic, (2) draw conclusions about the problem from their analysis of collected/given data, and (3) argue the contestable aspects of these conclusions. Students will need to focus their research problems so that they are able to fully explicate their arguments within the 1,000-word limit. Students should use both primary sources (sources of data to be analyzed1f40 to resolve the problem) and secondary sources (other studies used to show the research problem has not been raised but provide insights into how/if the problem might be resolved). The paper does not need to offer a final resolution, but it should advance the intended readers' understanding of the problem as described by the secondary sources. Topical Overview Ideas and Exposition I / Faculty Synopses IEM1201M: Sport and Competition Mark Brooke In professional, competitive sport, there appear to be fundamentally distinct ideas concerning human endeavour and the nature of competition that are worthy of critical examination.. Is winning everything? Should participation or self-defining achievement be more valued? Is sport becoming too elitist? Does the obsession to win create the need for performance-enhancing drugs? Should we legalize doping or tighten control measures? Should we change the nature of professional competitive sport? Students will explore these questions through close analysis of viewpoints expressed in both scholarly literature and popular media, ultimately developing their own positions in written arguments. IEM1201N: Public Persona and Self-presentation Ma. Luisa C. Sadorra Public persona is a fundamental yet unarticulated aspect of persuasion in spoken discourse. In this course, students will explore and examine speakersâ€™ public persona with a focus on interactional and social roles in performed presentations before a public audience. What does it mean to perform a public persona? How is public persona shaped, strengthened, or attenuated? Is there such a thing as an â€œauthenticâ€? public persona? In seminar-type classes and, subsequently, in writing assignments, students will analyse verbal and nonverbal performance of a speaker or speakers in mediated and/or non-mediated contexts, and develop informed views of their public persona. IEM1201P: Heroes Jason Banta This module will explore the development and transformation of heroic figures across time and cultures, how people have reacted to these figures, and how these figures have been adapted. Students will engage with multiple versions of the â€œhero,â€? both male and female, from a variety of media (literature, film, television, graphic novel) and scholarly literature on the subject as a means to develop critical writing skills. Some questions we will ask include: What defines a heroic character? What do a societyâ€™s heroes reflect about its own values? What are the dangers of uncritical acceptance of heroes? IEM1201Q: English, Singlish and intercultural communication Wong Jock Onn Students will explore how a language is shaped by the culture in which it is used and how it in turn shapes its usersâ€™ views of other cultures. They will investigate the culture-specific aspects of language, how they colour speakersâ€™ worldviews, and how differences in worldviews may lead to intercultural misunderstanding. Students will develop reasoned positions on particular issues in intercultural communication and formulate arguments to defend their points of view. The focus will be on English and Singlish but other varieties of English and other languages will be used for comparison. IEM1201R: Oratory and the Public Mind Gene Segarra Navera This course discusses the nature of oratory and how it potentially influences the public mind, that is, how the public perceives, understands, and acts upon social and political realities.Â Â  Students will be introduced to ways of critically analyzing speeches as they interrogate the power and limitations of oratory in influencing audiences.Â  Students will consider the following questions:Â  What elements in the speeches enable speakers to â€˜adjust ideas to people and people to ideasâ€™?Â  How do speeches shape and are shaped by their contexts?Â  How are ideas expressed in the speeches transformed to create impact on the public mind? IEM1201S: Women in Film Lynette Tan This module explores the representation of women in film as a site of ideological struggle. Students will investigate the multi-facetted images of women that appear in selected films and engage in critical debates about the messages that these images convey, as well as the extent to which they are influenced by history and culture. With an understanding of film analysis and the concept of ideology, students will examine how diverse viewpoints are expressed in key scholarly readings and contemporary articles, and develop writing skills that enunciate their own position within the debates. IEM1201T: Ideology and Popular Culture in Singapore Andrew Corey Yerkes This module interprets Singaporean popular culture in terms of ideology, meaning the assumptions and cognitive habits that frame oneâ€™s understanding of the world and justify a certain set of social relations. Students will be introduced to influential theories of ideology, such as Althusserian interpellation and Gramscian hegemony, and more recent cognitivist approaches. We will engage with analyses of Singapore by political theorists, historians, and sociologists. The suitability of various theories of ideology to Singapore will be evaluated as we practice ideological critique on Singaporean popular cultural texts chosen by the students, to develop critical thinking and writing skills. I&E II Module Offerings Common Objectives Ideas and Exposition 2 modules are the second in a sequence (following Ideas & Exposition 1). Similar to the I&E I modules, I&E II modules help students improve their academic writing by engaging with content. Thus, each individual module will be designed around specific thematic content. The goal of the course is to use resea1f40rch into content in order to develop students' rhetorical awareness, habits of inquiry, and writing competencies. I&E II modules provide students with the opportunity to learn and apply five core strategies that underlie successful scholarly research and writing: Assessing the relevance and reliability of multiple sources, Understanding how theory and method inform and produce knowledge, Identifying and articulating exigent research questions, Synthesizing multiple sources to construct and support hypotheses, Revising one's own thesis, methodological orientation, evidence, and argumentation. These strategies will be applied as students produce research-based writing. This course guides students through 3 inter-related units. Each unit scaffolds materials and skills that culminate with an original research project in the third unit. Please note that individual courses will reflect specific topical content. The unit breakdown here describes features to be incorporated into all I&E II modules. Paper Assignments Unit 1 In unit 1 students will compile an annotated bibliography to record and organize their sources in the early stages of the research process. The purpose of this assignment is to help students review existing literature on a given topic in order to determine a line of inquiry/research problem. Unit 2 Drawing on the resources they have developed in the first unit, students will write a brief research proposal describing the topic and scope of their proposed research project Unit 3 At this point in the semester, students have completed their annotated bibliography and literature review. Building from these previous assignments, they will now undertake their own research project. The research project will ask them to formulate a research problem based on the findings of their two previous assignments. For this unit, students will need to develop a thesis statement that they can support with their own, primary sources. They will use their analysis of these primary sources to converse with the ongoing academic discourse surrounding their top. Topical Overview Ideas and Exposition II / Faculty Synopses IEM2201E: Ethics in Outer Space Victor Cole Venturing into space, the most hostile of extreme environments, poses a host of complex and unusual challenges to human well-being. Through examination of the physiological, psychological and social factors that astronauts must contend with, students will engage with the ethical questions that confront governmental and private agencies when sending men and women into space. Before selecting specific ethical questions to explore in their research papers, students will also examine the motivations (scientific, commercial, political) behind different kinds of space mission and consider the moral obligations humankind may be under with regard to the exploration and potential exploitation of extraterrestrial environments. IEM2201H: RISK and Popular Culture Anuradha Ramanujan We live in a time characterized by an intensified awareness of risk. Our perception of risk, whether related to new technology or social activity, is greatly influenced by how mass media represents it. Taking prominent social theories of risk as its critical frame of reference, this course will explore the role of news, television shows, popular fiction and films in shaping public opinion on, and responses to, potential and presumed threats. These range from environmental pollution, pathogens and medical procedures to terrorism, cybercrime, immigration/immigrants and un(der)employment. Case studies may include Fukushima, Chernobyl and the Y2K phenomenon. IEM2201J : Blood, Death and Desire, Interpreting the Vampire Coleen Angove Vampire literature has undergone a twenty-first Century resuscitation, evident in novels such as Twilight and television series including The Vampire Diaries and True Blood. But how similar are these vampires to the traditional vampire in Western and other cultures? In this module you will explore different explanations for the role/function of the Vampire and have the opportunity to research manifestations of the Vampire across cultures, genres and historical periods. You will review different research methodologies, and compile a list of terms and ideas that enable you to participate in the conversation to understand the ongoing fascination with the Vampire. IEM2201K: Public Memory, Identity and Rhetoric Patrick Wade This research-based writing module examines the intersections of public memory, identity, and rhetoric in contemporary Singapore. In the module, students will con762sider theories and methodologies drawn from the interdisciplinary field of memory studies and practice applying them in a variety of Singaporean contextsâ€”considering, for example, the Singapore Memory Project, local museums, plays, political speeches, the preservation and transformation of memorial spaces or historical sites such as Bukit Brown cemetery, and more. Students will use their new knowledge of the rhetorical power of memory to embark on their own research project examining course themes. IEM2201L: Visualizing Southeast Asian Cities Elmo Gonzaga In this research-based module, we will explore how urban spaces across Southeast Asia have been imagined through visual forms like cinema, painting, advertising, and digital media. Using historical, theoretical, and anthropological texts as models, we will inquire into the process by which images negotiate and redefine the contours and notions of the geographies they are made to replace. How do movies transform disregarded cityscapes into protagonists? How are photographs and postcards of abandoned or demolished structures incorporated into historical memory? How do territorial, tourist, and transit maps shape aspirations of citizens and migrants? Students can pursue one of several trajectories.     88f © Copyright 2001- National University of Singapore.
