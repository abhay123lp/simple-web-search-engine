The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) prints and issues 100 million BRAND NEW $2 polymer notes to the banks each Lunar New Year. However, only about half of the new $2 notes issued are required to meet normal circulation demand. This is a waste of resources and is not environmentally-friendly. Printing the excess 50 million $2 notes uses more than 200,000 kWh of electricity! </p><p>Go Green&hellip; This year, MAS has embarked on an initiative to encourage the public to use &ldquo;good-as-new&rdquo; $2 notes for &ldquo;hong bao&rdquo;. The &ldquo;good-as-new&rdquo; $2 notes are clean and crisp notes which are retrieved right after Lunar New Year last year. These $2 notes will be made available at all retail banks in Singapore from 21 January 2013. </p><p>Take Action Now!

However, a study by Krantz and McClannahan (1994) discovered that only 28% of paper discarded would be recycled when there was one central recycling receptacle, most of the discarded paper goes into the trash bins when it is recyclable. This is a stark contrast from the recycling of 88% discarded paper when the paper recycling bins are placed in close proximity to users. http://nus.edu.sg/oes/prog/do/greenalert/dec2711_wasted_paper.html http://feeds.rapidfeeds.com/?iid4ct=6463204 Wed, 28 Dec 2011 21:44:00 EDT Turn off The Vampires! Vampires have been lurking around all year round without you knowing it but fret not because Santa is coming to town!Vampires are electronic equipments that draw electricity even when they are “switched off”. The extra loads that these equipments draw are known as phantom loads. University of California Berkeley reports that phantom load is responsible for 6% of residential electricity used. In an office, perennial suspects include computer displays, speakers, printers, and copiers among others. The blinking orange light on your PC monitors’ switch button when you have shut down your computer is one indicator that the monitor is still drawing electricity. In general, any light or display from inactive electronic equipment means that electricity is being consumed. http://nus.edu.sg/oes/prog/do/greenalert/dec2311_phantom_load.html http://feeds.rapidfeeds.com/?iid4ct=6463203 Wed, 28 Dec 2011 21:40:00 EDT Carpooling Carpooling has sprung up in the past few months.

Green transport can also be considered as an alternative form for transportation within campus. Sustainable transport refers to any vehicle that has a low impact on the environment, and is fuel-efficient. Such transport is not only efficient, but also convenient for individuals like staff who is required to travel extensively on campus (E.g. staff from the Office of Campus Security, the Office of Estate and Development etc). It can also be used as a means of transport for students or academic staff living on campus. http://nus.edu.sg/oes/prog/transport/bikeboard.html http://feeds.rapidfeeds.com/?iid4ct=6442787 Thu, 08 Dec 2011 02:55:00 EDT Kent Ridge Heritage Trail Storyboard The National University of Singapore (NUS) sits on a unique piece of real estate – Kent Ridge (formerly known as Pasir Panjang Ridge).

Without an avenue to recycle these pens, the girls were led to reflect upon our pen-using culture—we take pens for granted; when we’re done with one, there are a thousand more waiting to be bought at the nearest bookstore. It was then that the girls decided to start a project about pens and send a recycling message out to people who use the most pens: students. Hence, Save That Pen was borne. http://www.nus.edu.sg/oes/prog/waste/pens.html http://feeds.rapidfeeds.com/?iid4ct=4994460 Tue, 16 Mar 2010 07:18:00 EDT NUS Recycling Masterplan Secures NEA 3R Funding To support new waste minimisation and recycling projects, NEA launched an $8mil 3R Fund last year.

Often times, bottled water manufacturers purchase rights from local governments to pump water from their rivers and streams. This results in arid land that can no longer support farming and cause irreversible damage to the ecology. In undeveloped countries, the poor who live off these precious water resources are even refused the right to access the clean water for their very own survival. http://www.nus.edu.sg/oes/resources/policy_circular/bottled_more.html http://feeds.rapidfeeds.com/?iid4ct=4143438 Fri, 04 Sep 2009 06:11:00 EDT Advisory on The Use of Bottled Water NUS recognises the environmental and economic impacts of the consumption of bottled water.

Whilst there are many types of hybrid cars in the market, the Director of Campus Security, Mr Seah Thian Pau, explained that the advantage of the IMA lies in the use of regenerative braking. This technology captures some of the energy lost through deceleration, and reuses this energy to help accelerate the vehicle. This results in an improvement in the efficiency of the acceleration, which ultimately reduces the fuel consumption. In addition, vehicles equipped with the IMA automatically shuts down the engine when the vehicle comes to a stop; and uses the electric motor instead of the convention fuel motor to rapidly spin it back up when the brake paddle is released, which equates to MORE FUEL SAVED! http://www.nus.edu.sg/oes/resources/articles/hybridcar.html http://feeds.rapidfeeds.com/?iid4ct=4138228 Wed, 02 Sep 2009 21:19:00 EDT Stop Styrofoam!
