When will I receive my first stipend payment? Registrar's Office will usually submit a list of new scholars to the Office of Financial Services (OFS) by the 5th of each month. If OFS is not notified by the 5th, we will arrange to have the first month's stipend paid together with the following month's stipend. 2. When is pay day for research scholars? Pay day for research scholars falls on the 18th of each month. However, if the 18th of a month falls on a weekend, public holiday, eve of Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa or Deepavali, the pay day will be brought forward to an earlier weekday. 3. How is the first month's stipend computed? The stipend is computed on a pro-rated basis based on the number of working days in the month. For example, if the date of registration of the Research Scholarship Agreement states 7th of August 2009, the stipend will be computed as 17/21 days x $1,500.00. 4. As pay day is on the 18th of the month, which is the period being covered by this payment? The stipend paid is for a calendar month, i.e. from the first of the month to the last day of the month. 5. Why is my stipend not paid to me in full in January and August every year? Mandatory Miscellaneous Fees (MMF) will be deducted from your January and August's stipend. You may refer to the following link for more information on MMF: https://share.nus.edu.sg/registrar/info/gd/GDMisc2004-5.pdf 6. Why is my stipend being withheld? It could be due to any of the following reasons: Renewal of Research Scholarship Extension of Research Scholarship Leave of Absence Cessation of Research Scholarship Submission of Thesis Candidature converted to part-time Termination/Withdrawal of candidature. When the Office of Financial Services (OFS) receives the renewal/extension from the Registrar's Office, your stipend will be credited into your bank account by the following pay day. 7. When will I receive my last stipend? When the Office of Financial Services receives the notification letter to cease your research scholarship, your last stipend will be credited to your bank account by the following pay day. Your last month's stipend may be pro-rated to the end date of your research scholarship. 8. Is my stipend subject to income tax? NO, your research scholarship stipend and top-ups/augmentations are not subject to income tax. However, if you are also receiving income under the Part-time Teaching Scheme, these payments will be subjected to income tax. 9.
