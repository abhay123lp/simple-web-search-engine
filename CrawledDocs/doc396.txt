The NUS Overseas Colleges programme is an internship programme with a strong emphasis on technology entrepreneurship. Students will get to intern with your technology start-ups located either in Philadelphia, Shanghai or Silicon Valley, while studying part-time entrepreneurship related courses at University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University and Fudan University. You will get youthful, vigorous and gifted interns. As they would be interning with you for about a year, these interns will then be able to contribute to your start-up on a larger scale. What's more, these interns are familiar with the Singapore and Asian business culture and would be a great asset to you when you decide to venture into the Asian markets. To take part in the programme, simply contact us.   What Participating Companies Say "This is the second year DE Global has hosted an NUS Overseas College intern. Our first year with Lee Xiangling was excellent and set a high bar for expectations of future NUS students. This year with Wilfred Kong has exceeded our expectations. It has been an outstanding experience for us and I believe we have been able to contribute in some small way to Wilfred's education and introduction to the business world. We look forward to a third year with Tong Wei Wei. She has some high expectations to meet as a result of our experience during the first two years. I commend NUS in its initiative to help foster the entrepreneurial spirit in Singapore. From what I see to this point, the program will be successful." -- Edward Gwinn, Managing Director, DE Global Ltd., Shanghai "During each of the four years since the founding of my company Bio.enterprise LLC, the student interns from the National University of Singapore have made major contributions to the development of the company, its successes and the business. Each year a new intern has dedicated his or her time, expertise, dedication and enthusiasm to the work at hand. Liting Tan, Huiying Tan, Najieb Zain and Jia Xian Seow have all gone beyond their comfort zone and in entrepreneurial zeal have applied the lessons learned in their business classes to creating and developing the company. Together we have obtained several millions in funding for other small businesses, increased their valuation, improved their product development and established alliances and strategic partners to assist our clients in their business development. I have come to depend on the dedication, honesty, enthusiasm, creativity of these students in the good times and during the times of challenges." -- Sandra G. McElligott, Managing Director, Science Center "I have been so impressed with the NUS programme. From my first interaction with NUS students at an Open House I could see and feel the energy, initiative and positive attitude of the students. Gean Chu listened to what our criteria was in an intern and found a great fit for us. Our intern started in January and has contributed positively to our company. He has exceeded our expectations." -- Elise C. Furman, President, Scientific Software Tools, Inc. ".. this has been one of my best experiences to work with such a well organized entrepreneurial group from Singapore. The quality of your intern is remarkable to say the least.." -- Josh Ding, VP of Operations & Co-Founder, Navio Technologies, Inc. "I think the world of Shantanu.
