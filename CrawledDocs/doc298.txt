They must pass that level before being allowed to move on to the next. GEC modules aim to develop international graduate studentsâ€™ English writing skills. To this end ES5000 (Basic English) enhances studentsâ€™ basic academic language competence in writingc1c, while ES5001A (Intermediate English) builds on this competence and prepares students for specific writing tasks at the graduate level, such as writing data commentaries and reports. Finally, ES5002 assists research students in writing their Ph.D. theses.     *Please note that the ES5001B Speaking & Listening module is no longer running.
