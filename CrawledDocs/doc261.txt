Home About Blog Request Contact Login Using Embeddable Getty Images by Joan Wee | Apr 4, 2014 | ALL, Useful Tools and Tips | 0 comments Last month, Getty Images revised their term of use and allow their images to be embedded on other websites for free. The embedded images are watermark free and comes with a little note below the image stating the image copyright holder (see below sample). By embedding the images, it allows Getty to track how the image is being use and shared and can generate data for future potential use. To embed the image, search on getty images and then click on the embed icon to retrieve the code. Do take note of the term of use for embedded images as retrieved 4 April 2014 from Getty Images.
