Current initiatives to establish human iPSC (hiPSC) banking face challenges in recruiting large numbers of donors with diverse diseased, genetic, and phenotypic representations. In this study, we describe the efficient derivation of transgene-free hiPSCs from human finger-prick blood. Finger-prick sample collection can be performed on a "do-it-yourself" basis by donors and sent to the hiPSC facility for reprogramming. We show that single-drop volumes of finger-prick samples are sufficient for performing cellular reprogramming, DNA sequencing, and blood serotyping in parallel. Our novel strategy has the potential to facilitate the development of large-scale hiPSC banking worldwide. type:  Journal Paper journal:  Stem Cells Translational Medicine, Mar 19, 2014, doi: 10.5966/sctm.2013-0195 pubmed:  24646489 Url:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646489 Date of acceptance:  2014-01-17 Authors:  TAN HK TOH CX MA D YANG B LIU TM LU J WONG CW TAN TK SYN C TAN EL LIM B LIM Yoon-Pin COOK SA LOH YH
