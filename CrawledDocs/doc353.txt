Registration refers to a formal process whereby a student enrols at the start of his/her period of study to become part of the NUS student community. All students are required to first complete an online pre-registration prior to reporting in person to the relevant registration centre to complete the registration procedures, which normally commences on the week before the beginning of the semester. To be deemed a ‘registered student’, one must have registered, enrolled for the appropriate classes, and paid the prescribed fees. A student ceases to be registered upon being conferred the degree for which he/she is a candidate, or on leaving the University, either through withdrawal on his/her own accord or termination of candidature by the University.
