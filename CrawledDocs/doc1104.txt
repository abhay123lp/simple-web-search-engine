From growing through industrialisation in the early years to powering the economy through knowledge and innovation in the last two decades, Singaporeís economic landscape has diversified significantly and grown from strength to strength, pulled back only momentarily by global crises. Twenty years on, after Singaporeís first directed and definitive 5-year plan, the National Technology Plan (1991-1995) to boost research and development (R&D) activities and investments, Singapore has entered the league of R&D-intensive countries. Between 1990 and 2009, Singaporeís Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by more than 3.7 times, with R&D expenditure accounting for 2.3% of the GDP. Singaporeís successful transformation into a knowledge-based/innovation-driven economy can be attributed to the swift and concerted efforts by both the public and private sectors to grow the countryís science and technology (S&T) assets, a holistic national R&D framework and strategy as well as long term commitment by the Government to stay invested in R&D. A*STARís Science, Technology & Enterprise Plan (STEP) 2015, is a culmination of more than 2 years of planning, incorporating valuable inputs from experts and leaders in the research community and industry, both local and international, as well as the key economic agencies in Singapore.
