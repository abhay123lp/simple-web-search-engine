Trends come and go, but one thing remains unchanged—people love a true, authentic original.  That would explain the latest sandal du jour in the fashion world: the Teva Original Universal.  The sporty sandal is certainly no stranger on the runway, with haute fashion houses like Prada, Marc Jacobs  & Lanvin getting in on this unlikely sartorial obsession inspired by classic outdoor/sport sandals like Teva. 1.

In January 2010, David Allemann, Olivier Bernhard, and Caspar Coppetti collaborated to found On™ running footwear. Their mission was simple: to bring awareness to the highly enjoyable side of running instead of focusing solely on the healthy-for-you aspect of the sport. Together the three cofounders worked to craft a running shoe that would boast superior cushioning without sacrificing efficiency. The Swiss footwear company has since come a long way from the brand’s very first prototype, which involved slicing and adhering garden hose to the bottom of a shoe’s outsole. July 2010 saw the brand’s premier launch, when the Cloudsurfer became the very first On running shoe to hit the shelves of European specialty running stores. Today, whether you are a seasoned runner or a newbie to barefoot-inspired running, you are sure to find your sole mate among the brand’s five core styles: Cloudster, Cloudrunner, Cloudsurfer, Cloudracer, and Cloud. On footwear provides its wearer with all of the benefits of natural-inspired running, without compromising comfort or protection against injury. Each and every On shoe features CloudTec™ technology; it is a revolutionary cushioning system that activates during the foot’s landing phase, then becomes firm to encourage an effective toe-off. With each foot strike, the highly adaptive rubber “cloud” outsole pods provide both vertical and horizontal cushioning for a soft landing. Once on the ground, the clouds interlock, forming a solid foundation that promotes a natural, powerful takeoff. Embrace a new running experience that is fast, light, and agile. Embrace the innovation of On running shoes. SHOP ON RUNNING SHOES >> Be the first to comment!

What an amazing time it is to be @InsideZappos! First we’re in a blender, now we’re sav00000C2Fing lives - What?!! Just kidding. All “Internship” movie quotes aside, we’re super excited to carry on our recruiting visibility efforts, leveraging social media to make the stereotypical mundane hiring process a more personable one. As we scale, our goal is to not only protect the Zappos culture, but root our talent brand by focusing on what’s most important - candidate experience! My name is Kyle, and I’m a technical talent sourcer here at Zappos.com, Inc. I proactively scour the globe for the most technically capable and culturally sound candidates who will contribute to the Zappos vision. June will mark my 2 year anniversary with the Zappos family and I couldn’t be happier! I am thankful for the support of the good people here who have encouraged me to take risks. Big shoutout to Augusta Scott, our very own @zapposcoach. She helps change lives for the better. My journey to Zappos began back in December 2011 when I filmed my first and only video cover letter. (Enjoy!) A Zappos recruiter reached out after my 3rd time applying for various merchandising assistant roles. Like many, I assumed merchandising is where everyone starts, Zappos being an e-commerce site selling shoes, clothing and all. My recruiter was patient enough to let me know that most folks start in the call center, learn the company, and then apply to positions they’re passionate about. I was wowed away by that! Most of the other companies I applied to at the time didn’t even bother to let me know they filled the position already. Being my first encounter with a Zapponian, that’s when two things were confirmed for me: (1) Zappos is a special place with people who care & (2) I wanted to pay that kindness forward and WOW potential candidates like she did. Fast forward to June 2012, I took that advice, applied for the call center role, and was selected to join the Customer Loyalty Team on the phones. After a year of “wowing” customers via phone and live chat, I decided to “pursue growth and learning.” (One of Zappos' ten core values.) I applied for the internal Sourcing Z’Apprentice role with recruiting and got it! I even emailed my original recruiter to let her know that I would not be here if it weren’t for her support during my journeys’ infancy. After three months of rocking the Z’Apprenticeship, recruiting converted me to full time status, and now I live my dream job every day! I get to find and engage talent for one of the best brands in the world000021BE. I am so humbled by my Zappos expedition thus far and can’t wait to see what the next chapter in this developing story will bring!  Last week was an incredibly successful maiden voyage for @InsideZappos new Social VIP program because Christina Bates (@CBates9) let her boundless energy and enthusiasm shine through her tweets.
