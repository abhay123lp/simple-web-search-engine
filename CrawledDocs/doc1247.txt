The Aeronautical Specialisation imbues you with the knowledge and skills, and you will never see things flying in the same way again. With over three years of training in fundamental mechanical engineering knowledge of mechanics, controls, thermodynamics, manufacturing, materials and general mechanical system design, your career path is also a versatile one outside of the aeronautical industry. Khoo Kent Loong Energy Systems (Energy & Thermal Process) Specialisation The Energy Systems Specialisation has provided me in-depth technical knowledge of energy technology and its applications. I realised that we as engineers can make an impact on society by improving our use of scarce energy sources. It has motivated me to engage in green technology projects. We also have opportunities to embark on a more global education through overseas programmes, as well as learning from and working with the best in the industry. Farah Bte Mohd Faudzi Industryâ€“Sponsored Design Project Participating in the local-overseas joint industrial design project broadened my perspective and stretched my ability. Tapping into the knowledge and capabilities of our overseas counterparts brought a multi-perspective engineering solution to our project. Social interactions within the group led to exchanges of ideas, culture, knowledge and the development of cross-cultural friendships that last, even till today. The whole journey was fruitful and satisfying, especially when your efforts had borne fruit. Koh You Cheng Energy Systems Specialisation Despite depleting natural fuel resources, the world continues to consume more energy every day. The Energy Systems Specialisation provided us the training and also gave us the opportunity to spearhead exciting projects in sustainability. Our award-winning engineering solutions have been applied in diverse industries, from offshore to aerospace. If you are passionate about contributing to a sustainable future, Energy Systems is the right specialisation for you! Chester Foo & Ruby William Mechanical Engineering Programme The NUS Mechanical Engineering Department is the place where innovation meets intellect. Boundless possibilities, coupled with excellent faculty and an ever growing pool of very talented individuals who offer support at every turn, bring students to the forefront of their curve. Experiences gained. Opportunities provided. Knowledge received. Friendships forged. I can pursue my career with great promise and confidence. It is truly here that the future begins.
