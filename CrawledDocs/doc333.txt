Full-time students are expected to commit themselves to at least 40 hours of study per week. The University strongly discourages full-time students from taking up employment during term time that might interfere with their studies.  Students should note that commitments from employment will not be accepted as valid reasons for absence, uncompleted work, late submission of work, or poor performance, and may lead to exclusion from certain full-time programmes.         © Copyright 2001-2011 National University of Singapore.
