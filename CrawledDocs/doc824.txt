The Protein Cloning and Expression Core provides fast, efficient cloning and expression services to researchers at MBI and NUS. The MBI Protein Cloning and Expression Facility is a new, breakthrough facility using highest development technologies to produce products enabling new discoveries in mechanobiology. Managed by four full-time research staff, the Core provides high-quality, purified recombinant proteins from different host systems (E.coli, yeast, insect and mammalian) and custom-made expression vectors with selective markers. The final products are characterized by their purity, promoting and assuring accuracy for quality research. The Core also provides consultation services and training for new staff inexperienced in molecular biology and protein purification protocols. Managed by 4 full-time research staff, the Core provides high quality, purified recombinant proteins for MBI researchers. A collection of fluorescent proteins with different colors The MBI Protein Cloning and Expression Core has collected and/or constructed a series of fusion vectors, which provide the opportunities to label and trace the target genes in vivo under microscope. The core has developed high-throughput â€œin-fusionâ€? approaches to label any target genes with different colors, ranging from green, yellow, red to cherry. In addition, the core facility is developing the new approaches to make novel fluorescent proteins with â€œtailor-madeâ€? colors based on structures.
