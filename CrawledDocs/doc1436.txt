Nine West please don't make this a habit. It's making me sad. Naturalizer Carlita Posted: Apr 8, 2014 Reviewer: Sue Overall: Comfort: Look: Beautiful shoes. They felt like instant favorites the moment I put them on. Unfortunately, the right heel makes a snapping sound with each step. I'll return them for a replacement pair. I'm looking forward to wearing them. Reebok Zigkick Dual Posted: Apr 8, 2014 Reviewer: from Georgia Overall: Comfort: Look: Slightly narrower than other wides I've purchased, but still wider than a Medium width. Tried wearing these to my job where I stand all day and I won't do that again. Think these will be great walking00004000/exercise shoes where I'd be wearing them for shorter periods of time than a whole day. Enzo Angiolini Deanja Posted: Apr 8, 2014 Reviewer: Overall: Comfort: Look: Love these boots. The leg IS pretty narrow - fits me nice and snug, and I fairly small calves. Looks good and is pretty comfy. SKECHERS Gratis - Legendary Posted: Apr 8, 2014 Reviewer: Overall: Comfort: Look: These shoes are really light weight &amp;amp; comfy. Probably should have ordered a smaller size. They fit great when I first got them, but now that I have worn them with socks they slip around on my feet without them. I won't be able to use them much during the summer because it will be too hot for socks. I may try washing them to see if they shrink a 1/2 size. ASICS GEL-Fluxâ„¢ Posted: Apr 8, 2014 Reviewer: from Georgia Overall: Comfort: Look: I'm on my feet all day at work, and these shoes give me support and comfort! Naturalizer Electron Posted: Apr 8, 2014 Reviewer: Megan M. from San Francisco Bay Area Overall: Comfort: Look: Very cozy and smart professional shoe. It fits like a glove. I have super narrow feet, so shoes are usually slipping off of me. But for these, I almost needed a shoe horn. They feel amazing once they're on and are easy to get off. No uncomfortable rubbing anywhere, not even after a long day. No slippage as I walk or run to catch the train. No squeaking. They really are like a second skin. I gave four stars for style instead of 5 for two reasons: 1) I like that there was a navy option, but I'd love if it came in other darker, more adventurous pseudo professional colors, like hunter or burgundy. 2) Also, it'd be great if there was a similar style with a slightly higher heel height to make this a better after-work-on-a-Friday shoe. This is great for after work on a Thursday, but not really dressy enough for going out on the town at the end of the week. Maybe one shoe can't do it all, but I'd sure try this style with a higher heel. Thank you, Naturalizer, for making stylish narrow shoes. :) Seychelles Just The Beginning Posted: Apr 8, 2014 Reviewer: from NYC Overall: Comfort: Look: These look just as pictured, really cute spring shoe. I usually wear a 7 but a 6Â½ in Seychelles, and in these a 6 was actually perfect. They are surprisingly really comfortable. I have slightly wide feet but they do not pinch. I would suggest ordering a full size smaller than normal, especially if you have narrower feet. Patagonia Drifter A/C Posted: Apr 8, 2014 Reviewer: Cheryl G from Covington, Louisiana Overall: Comfort: Look: These shoes are absolutely the best shoes I have worn in years! If you have any type of foot issues, you should give these a try. I had foot surgery three years ago that left me almost crippled in my left foot, and finding a shoe that I could wear without pain was almost impossible until I came across these shoes. I want to thank the reviewer that stated that these shoes had "Changed her life" because they have changed mine too! I now have happy feet, and a pep in my step for the first time in many years. Softspots Posie Posted: Apr 8, 2014 Reviewer: Wendelynn Gunderson from United States Overall: Comfort: Look: These are beautiful shoes, nicely padded insoles and lovely detail. I really liked the low vamp as I have one foot that was broken right in the arch years ago and now I have a lot of arthritis in the break that makes it very hard to find a shoe that fits over that spot. So the low vamp was really a selling point. I ordered 9WW which normally fits me in Easy Spirit and Hush Puppies, however, the toebox was too narrow at the very end of the shoe. Ingrown toenails is not something that I want from a pair of shoes. I tried walking in the house in them anyway and the heel was much too loose and the shoe literally kept coming off my foot as I walked. I am sending them back. Zappos Family Core Value: 10.
