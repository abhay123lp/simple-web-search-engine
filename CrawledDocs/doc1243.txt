Students in Singapore are able to think flexibly and creatively when faced with complex and unfamiliar problems. In a real-world situation, they would be able to find information, use intuition and dare to experiment with alternative solutions. This is according to the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) computer-based assessment of Problem Solving, organised by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Of the 44 education systems that participated in this international benchmarking study, Singapore students came up joint-first with Korea students. "Singapore's education system has at times been criticised for encouraging rote learning at the expense of developing creative skills. The PISA 2012 assessment of problem solving skills proves those critics wrong," said Mr Andreas Schleicher, Special Advisor to the Secretary-General on Education Policy and Deputy Director for Education and Skills of OECD. This PISA finding has helped to validate the broad-based approach to education that the Ministry of Education has been emphasising, which provides students with rich learning opportunities in real-world contexts.

Photo Credit: Mr Woo Kok OonHow far would your passion take you? For Mr Woo Kok Oon, his love for his job as a Physical Education (PE) teacher brought him on a 10-week journey to nine areas of Thailand in 2008, as Thailand is known to be one of the few top Asian nations in volleyball. There, he observed the training routines of volleyball teams. This also meant roughing it out with the local students in the rural provinces, such as Watlaharn, Saraburi, Si Saket and even Ubon, which is 650km away from the city of Bangkok. Though the circumstances were difficult, Mr Woo observed how the Thai students learnt important life lessons through sports training. Enriched by this experience, Mr Woo adapted and introduced some of the Thai practices to the girls' volleyball team of Yuying Secondary School, where he teaches PE. "Through sports, we can reach out to a person and develop character," said Mr Woo, who continues to broaden his perspectives and improve his PE teaching methods , in spite of having more than 20 years of teaching and coaching experience under his belt.
