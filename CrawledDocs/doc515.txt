Representative grade profiles of the 10th and 90th percentiles of applicants offered places in AY 2013/2014 for applicants holding Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-level qualifications are shown in Table 1. The grade profiles refer to the grades scored by Singapore-Cambridge A-level applicants in their three H2 and one H1 subjects. For the purpose of this notification, Grade C is assumed for both General Paper (GP) and Project Work (PW) in determining the grade profiles. Please note that certain courses may require grades higher than Grade C for GP. Please refer to Table 1 for the Grade Profiles of the 10th and 90th percentiles of A-level applicants offered places for courses at NUS in AY 2013/2014. Representative polytechnic Grade Point Averages (GPA) of the 10th and 90th percentiles of local polytechnic applicants offered places for courses at NUS in AY 2013/2014 are shown in Table 2. Please note that in addition to the Polytechnic GPA, the Singapore-Cambridge O-level results of polytechnic applicants are also taken into account for university admissions. Please refer to Table 2 for the Polytechnic GPAs of the 10th and 90th percentiles of polytechnic applicants offered places for courses at NUS in AY 2013/2014. The number of course places taken up NUS for AY 2013/2014 is shown in Table 3. It is important to note that the number of course places changes from year to year. Applicants seeking admission in AY2014/2015 can expect competition to be keener for courses with more stringent grade requirements and fewer places. In using the tables below, please note the following: The grade profiles, GPAs and course places may vary from year to year, depending on the number and performance of applicants and the number of places available. Meeting the previous year’s grade/GPA scores of a course does NOT guarantee admission to that course for AY2014/2015. The courses marked with an asterisk (*) are those where additional assessments such as interviews, selection tests, and portfolios are required. •    Certain courses may have specific subject requirements. Details can be found at NUS Admissions website. For more information on the disclosure of grade profiles, please refer to our FAQ here. ____________________________________ 1    These provide an indication of the grade profiles for the majority of applicants admitted in AY 2013/2014. There could be other equivalent profiles for each course. For example, a grade profile of ABC/C could be considered to be broadly equivalent to BBB/C, unless there are other pre-requisites.   Table 1: Grade Profiles of the 10th and 90th percentiles of A-Level Applicants offered places for courses at NUS in Academic Year 2013-20142 NUS Courses Representative Grade Profile 3H2/1H1 10th percentile 90th percentile Faculty of Law Law* AAA/A AAA/A School of Medicine Medicine* AAA/A AAA/A Nursing* CCC/B AAA/C Faculty of Dentistry Dentistry* AAA/A AAA/A School of Design & Environment Architecture* AAB/C AAA/A Industrial Design* BBB/C AAA/A Project & Facilities Management BBC/B AAB/C Real Estate BBB/C AAA/C Faculty of Engineering Engineering BBC/C AAA/A Bioengineering BCC/B AAA/A Chemical Engineering AAB/C AAA/A Civil Engineering BBC/C AAA/A Electrical Engineering BCC/B AAA/A Environment Engineering BCC/B AAB/B Engineering Science BBC/C AAA/A Industrial & Systems Engineering ABB/B AAA/A Materials Science & Engineering BCC/B AAA/A Mechanical Engineering BCC/B AAA/A School of Computing Computing (Business Analytics) AAB/B AAA/A Computing (Computer Science) BBB/C AAA/A Computing (Information Systems) AAB/B AAA/A Faculty of Engineering & School of Computing     Computer Engineering BCC/B AAA/B Faculty of Science Pharmacy AAA/A AAA/A Science BBC/B AAA/A School of Business Business Admin AAA/B AAA/A Business Admin (Accountancy) AAA/A AAA/A Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences Arts & Social Sciences ABB/C AAA/A Arts & Social Sciences (MT related) BBC/B ABB/C Environmental Studies Environmental Studies AAB/B AAA/A * Courses that require interview &/or test. 2 Double degrees are excluded from the table.
