Introduction This fast–track 4-year programme allows students to graduate with a Master degree in Management (thereafter called MPhil(M)) from Cambridge University and a Bachelor degree in Information Systems (hereafter called B.Comp(IS)) from NUS. Students get a global education with 3 years at NUS and 1 year at Cambridge University. To apply for this programme, students must apply for Computing (Information Systems), offered by School of Computing, NUS. They can apply for direct admission to this programme. They will be chosen on the basis of their A-level grades (or equivalent), their interest profile in information systems studies, and a personal interview designed to judge their potential and suitability for the programme. Students will complete 144 modular credits (equivalent to 36 modules) of the B.Comp(IS) programme before they proceed to complete MPhil(M)) at Cambridge University. Sixteen modular credits (equivalent to 4 modules) will be counted against the modules in MPhil(M). Students who have successfully completed the stipulated four modules in theMPhil(M) programme will be awarded B.Comp(IS) from NUS. At the end of the MPhil(M) programme, the students will be conferred the second degree – MPhil(M) from Cambridge University. The intake to this B.Comp(IS) - MPhil(M) concurrent programme will be limited by agreement between Cambridge and NUS.   2. Partner University: Judge Business School, University of Cambridge The University of Cambridge, Judge Business School is one of the top business schools in Europe, offering a variety of teaching programmes including the Cambridge MBA, PhD, MPhil and undergraduate degrees together with a suite of Executive Education.   3. Programme structure This concurrent programme combines the Bachelor in Computing (Information Systems) offered by the School of Computing, NUS, and M.Phil in Management offered by the Judge Business School, Cambridge University, U.K. The Cambridge University’s MPhil in Management is a taught Masters' programme which offers new and recent  non-business/management graduates a thorough grounding in management. Students admitted to this programme will normally have a First Class Honours degree or its equivalent.  The details are listed here: 2010/11   4. Admission requirements & procedure The admission and progress criteria comply with the requirements established by both Cambridge and NUS. A joint steering committee comprising at least one faculty representative from each of the two universities will oversee the programme. Students may enter the concurrent degree programme at any point during their undergraduate study at NUS although it is preferred that they declare their interest at NUS matriculation. Direct admission Local applicants with A-level certificate or its equivalent can apply for direct admission to this programme when they submit their undergraduate admission applications to NUS via http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/. Applicants must select the ‘Computing (Information Systems Courses)' course before they can view the Concurrent Programme among the available choices. They will be chosen on the basis of their A-level grades (or equivalent), their interest profile in information systems studies, and a personal interview designed to judge their potential and suitability for the programme. During their course of study at NUS, students in the programme must maintain a high level of performance (CAP 4.50 and above) as judged by a joint steering committee. Students who do not meet this standard will be moved to the standard B.Comp(IS) programme at NUS. Admission to the Master's degree component of the programme, granted by the Judge Business School at Cambridge University, will be based on the student's academic performance, and recommendations of the joint steering committee. In-progress admission Students who have not opted for direct admission, but are admitted to SoC Information Systems course at NUS, may also declare their interest at NUS matriculation. Selection criteria for these students will be similar to those for direct admission. Information Systems students who are not granted direct entry into this Concurrent Programme but are accepted into the Department of Information Systems, may apply to the programme after their first year of studies. The call for applications will be announced to all existing students at an appropriate time. These students must demonstrate strong academic ability (gaining a CAP of 4.50 and above) and meet all criteria of the Concurrent Programme for BComp (IS). Admission of these students is subject to size constraint of the Concurrent Programme. Existing B.Comp(IS) students who have demonstrated strong academic abilities may be allowed to enter the programme at any stage of their study at NUS (subject to size constraints). These students are required to meet all the requirements of the programme.   5. Progression Criteria Students in this concurrent programme must maintain a Cumulative Average Point (CAP) of 4.50 or above (out of 5.00) for their B.Comp (IS) requirements. A student whose CAP falls below 4.50 for two consecutive semesters in NUS will not be allowed to remain in the concurrent programme, but may continue with his B.Comp(IS) study at NUS. Students who have completed the four core modules from the MPhil(M) programme but did not succeed in completing the entire MPhil(M) programme will only be awarded the BComp(IS) degree and not the MPhil(M) degree.   6. Tuition Fees Students will pay Cambridge tuition fees during the time they undertake instruction at Cambridge in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the concurrent degree. They will also provide their own medical insurance coverage. As far as possible, scholarship funding will be sought from iDA, EDB (Economic Development Board), and industry.   7. Degrees Students who satisfy the concurrent B.Comp(IS) - MPhil(M) degree requirements will be conferred both degrees.   8. Comparison of Tuition Fees and Duration This fast-track CDP provides excellent overseas experience at a fraction of the cost of an overseas undergraduate education and with a shorter time duration compared to doing an NUS undergraduate degree and the overseas Masters degree separately. For Singaporean students, the tuition fee for the 4-year CDP is approximately S$80,000 (subject to exchange rate conversion). In comparison, the tuition fees for a 3- year undergraduate degree at Cambridge University for non citizens (including mandatory college fees ranging between £4500 to £5500 per annum) is approximately S$150,000, and the tuition fees for a 3 year undergraduate degree followed by a Masters degree at CMU is approximately S$205,000. The typical duration of the CDP is 4 years in comparison with the total length of 5 years for doing the undergraduate and Master degree separately. Note : The information is based on estimated cost, your actual cost may be different. Please remember that tuition costs and college fees are also subject to change.   9.
