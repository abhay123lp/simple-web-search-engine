However, it also means that many problems in the world are global in nature, requiring countries to find solutions together. Arriving at effective solutions requires an inclusive and creative mindset, with an appreciation of each other's history, understanding of global and local perspectives, as well as an ability to collaborate, influence, consult and communicate with one another. Ms Grace Fu, Minister at the Singapore Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, shared this at the launch of the new Singapore Technologies Endowment Programme (STEP)-NUS Sunburst Environment Programme, which aims to spur participating youths to become champions of environmental protection. The programme is organised by STEP in partnership with the NUS Climate Change and Sustainable Environment Research Initiative hosted by the Tropical Marine Science Institute (TMSI) and the Raffles Museum for Biodiversity Research (RMBR) at NUS. Ms Fu urged the 130 young participants hailing from China, India and ASEAN to take the lead in making the environment a cleaner and greener place for everyone. Echoing this was Professor Leo Tan, Chairman of STEP and Director (Special Projects) at the NUS Faculty of Science. "The youths of today are in the best position to be good ecological stewards so that future generations can continue to enjoy the biodiversity and resources that we now have," he said. Professor Peter Ng, Director of TMSI and RMBR said that the programme would hopefully encourage students to understand the environmental issues in different countries and share ideas on protecting the environment. From 18 to 22 November 2013, the participating students aged between 13 and 15 learnt first-hand about climate change, conservation and sustainability from NUS researchers and international scientists such as Dr Simon Morley from the British Antarctic Survey and Professor Daniel Rittschof from Duke University. The attendees also joined workshops and study visits around Singapore such as the Sungei Buloh Nature Reserve, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and TMSI's St John's Island Marine Laboratory. In addition, student teams were able to apply their environmental knowledge by competing through essays, presentations and a quiz. < Prev Next > Most Popular Festive celebrations mark UTown's official opening CSI Singapore finds new way to â€œswitch onâ€? silenced tumour suppressors State of the University Address 2013: Mount Kailash and the paths beyond Recommended Natural history museum at NUS lays foundation NUS names Residential College in honour of Alice & Peter Tan Students promote spirit of volunteerism through "Kampung" day © Copyright 2001-2014 National University of Singapore.
