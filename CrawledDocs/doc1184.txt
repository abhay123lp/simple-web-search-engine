Yayasan MENDAKI (Council for the Development of Singapore Malay/Muslim Community) is a pioneer Self-Help Group formed in 1982 dedicated to empower the community through excellence in education, in the context of a multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore. In 2002, MENDAKI streamlined its focus along four key areas of Education, Youth, Family and Employability. † MENDAKI's programmes largely target the bottom 30% of the Malay/Muslim population and are therefore highly subsidized. They are mostly preventive and developmental programmes to provide early assistance to the beneficiaries. The programmes are designed to supplement or complement national initiatives.† † MENDAKI works extensively with partners that share and support its vision and mission. They consist of government agencies, schools, mosques, Malay/Muslim organisations, employers, community centres and MAECs, family & student service centres and many more. †† † † † Please click†here†for Yayasan MENDAKI 2012 Annual Report.
