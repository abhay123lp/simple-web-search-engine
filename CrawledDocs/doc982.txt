The original policy sought to eradicate poverty and achieve economic parity among the country's various ethnic communities. However, it was based on an apparent paradox - the use of ethnic preference to promote national unity. The policy's core tenet was affirmative action on behalf of the Bumiputera community. Drawing on a wealth of statistical and documentary evidence, this major new book provides a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the NEP. The contributors show that there have been some positive outcomes, among them a considerable reduction of poverty, greater interethnic equity parity and the emergence of a resourceful Bumiputera middle class. But these partial successes have to be weighed against persistent complaints associated with increasing intraethnic Bumiputera income disparities; the emergence of a small, politically powerful and disproportionately wealthy Bumiputera elite; a serious brain drain; and weak human capital. As a result, divisive debates about group rights, ethnic identity and an elusive national unity dominate Malaysia's policy discourse. The New Economic Policy in Malaysia offers a timely and fresh perspective, suggesting that the long-term implementation of racially-targeted policies reinforces stereotypical ethnic identities and hinders the creation of a more inclusive society. Edmund Terence GOMEZ is Professor of Political Economy at the Faculty of Economics and Administration, University of Malaya.
