The concurrent programme combining Bachelor of Computing (School of Computing) and Masters of Management (School of Business) provides a multi-disciplinary platform for students to marry strong technical computing skills with the requisite management, communications, and marketing skills to respond effectively to these challenges. In this programme, students of School of Computing will take management courses from School of Business in addition to their usual pursuit of Bachelor of Computing (Information Systems) degree. These management courses consist of 20 management and leadership modules drawn from BBA, MBA and PhD curricula. Thanks to the broad-base nature of NUS curriculum structure, such double focuses may be completed within five years. The programme is particularly attractive to students pursuing Bachelor of Computing degrees in Information Systems or E-Commerce, as the combined curricula provide an enriching education in management of both human resources and information technology. Following on from this concurrent programme is an European Master in International Management (MIM), which are eligible to students after completing this concurrent programme. Through this route, students can therefore get three degrees: Bachelor + MSc + MIM in 5.5 to 6 years. MIM requires students to spend half year in each of two top European management schools. About a quarter of MIM students end up as management consultants, many with the prominent corporate members of CEMS (Community of European Management Schools). School of Business is offering a number of scholarships for students to go to Europe . Detailed information about MIM can be found in http://bba.nus.edu/cems.htm . Direct admission Local applicants with A-level certificate or its equivalent can apply for direct admission to this programme when they submit their undergraduate admission applications to NUS via http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/. Applicants must select the ‘Computing (Information Systems Courses)' course before they can view this Concurrent Programme among the available choices. They will be chosen on the basis of their A-level grades (or equivalent), their interest profile in information systems studies, and a personal interview designed to judge their potential and suitability for the programme. In-Progress Admission Applicants who are not eligible for direct admission are welcome to apply for admission to this programme after they have been admitted to the `Computing (Information Systems Courses)’ course. Existing undergraduate students can also apply for admission to this programme. Details on application procedure for the concurrent MSc(Mgt) programme can be found at: http://bschool.nus.edu.sg/mscmgt/aboutmsc.htm Degree Structure The structure for the concurrent MSc(Mgt) programme is as follows:   40-MC Domain Knowledge Requirements (DKR) segment: A student must complete the following 10 modules, or 40 MCs, chosen from modules currently offered in the Minor in Business programme: 4 Level-1000 modules or their equivalents; 4 Level-2000 modules or their equivalents; and 2 Level-3000 modules: 1 module, or its equivalent, from each of 2 different areas out of those available. For details on modules listed under the Minor in Business, please refer to: http://bschool.nus.edu.sg/bba/minor.htm 40-MC MSc Requirements (MSR) segment : A student must complete 40 MCs from the modules below: at most 2 Level-4000 modules chosen from any offered by the School of Business, or equivalent modules; at least 3 Level-5000/6000 research-type coursework modules chosen from any offered by the School of Business ; and at most 5 MBA-type modules chosen from any offered by the School of Business , which had not been covered by the student for the DKR segment. The key features of the programme are listed below: School of Computing students use the MCs from breadth requirements and unrestricted electives (UEM) as well as equivalent modules from the BComp (Hons.) programme requirements to meet the 40-MC Domain Knowledge Requirements (DKR) segment. School of Computing students in the BComp (Hons.) (Information Systems) degree programmes are deemed to have satisfied item (1) of the MSR segment as their degree requirements include 16 MCs of level-4000 modules offered by the Information Systems Department. These modules are business and IT related. School of Computing students are allowed to partially meet item (3) of the MSR segment by taking up to 2 MBA-type equivalent coursework modules offered by the Information Systems Department listed below: •  IS5111 Integration of IS and Business (old module code: CS5251) •  IS5112 Knowledge Systems and Management in Organizations (old module code: CS5253) These two graduate modules cannot be used to satisfy the unrestricted electives of BComp requirements should students discontinue the concurrent programme. School of Computing students must meet all the other requirements for admission, continuation in the programme and the award of the concurrent programme. School of Computing students who have completed the MSc(Mgt) programme, as well as their BComp honours programme will be awarded two degrees depending on their honours classification for their bachelor programme. Please refer to: http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/undergraduates/cdp_bcompis_msc_structure.html for the module requirements, and computation of CAP, for this CDP. Degree Classification The MSc(Mgt) degree will be awarded to students who have •  earned at least a Second Class Lower division in the BComp(Hons.)(Information Systems) degree and •  maintained a CAP of 3.50 in the modules counting towards the MSc(Mgt) requirement.
