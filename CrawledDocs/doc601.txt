Entrusted as NUSâ€™s Technology Transfer Office, the roles and duties of ILO are: To protect, manage and promote the University's Intellectual Property                 To provide industry, faculty and staff with the highest quality service and guidance on matters relating to Intellectual Property management and commercialization To promote technology transfer and commercialisation of the University's innovations and expertise To encourage research collaboration between academic research and industry   Aligning its work closely to NUSâ€™s vision of becoming a global learning enterprise, ILO fosters University collaboration with industry through a variety of sponsored research and joint R&D projects across numerous scientific disciplines. At the same time, ILO helps to facilitate the translation of new discoveries and inventions by NUS researchers into useful products and services through the licensing of these technologies to either existing companies and / or new startup ventures. Combined with industry knowledge, a growing professional network and extensive legal expertise in Intellectual Property Management, ILO is well situated as a significant and critical part of Singaporeâ€™s technology transfer community.
