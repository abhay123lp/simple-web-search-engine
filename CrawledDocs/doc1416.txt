At NUS Law, we see ourselves as part of a global conversation about the study and practice of law. With outstanding faculty whose expertise embraces all major jurisdictions and topics, we encourage our students to come up with creative solutions to the legal problems that arise in our interconnected world. Frequently ranked as one of the best law schools in the world, our graduates have gone on to become leaders in legal practice, government ministers, Supreme Court judges, ambassadors, community leaders and in many other fields. While we continue to strive to move further up the ranks of top law schools, it is important that no deserving students are left behind. You can play a part in that effort by ensuring that needy and deserving students can take their education further. Your gift to NUS Law will also help us to continue making great strides in legal education and research that make an impact in Singapore and the rest of the world. No matter how meritocratic the system is, a personâ€™s true potential is limited by circumstance. Just as education is empowering, lack of money is crippling. I have experienced this first-hand and I would not be where I am today without the financial aid that I have received from the government and altruistic individuals. My own experience has taught me that giving to educational institutions is an essential complement to Singaporeâ€™s meritocratic system. Without financial support, I may well have been left behind. â€“ Shinyi Mak, Faculty of Law, Kwa Geok Choo Bursary recipient Why Give?
