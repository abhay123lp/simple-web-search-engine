Introduction This is a fast–track programme that allows deserving students to obtain the Bachelor of Computing (Computer Science) degree from NUS and a Scientiae Magister in Computer Science from the Brown University within five years. It offers an opportunity for the students to integrate professional development with a rich international experience. The programme commences in August 2011, with an expected intake of 5 to 10 students annually. 2. Partner University: Department of Computer Science of Brown University The Department of Computer Science, Brown University has an excellent reputation for innovative education and research, and for the tight interaction of theory and practice of Computer Science. It offers one of the leading computer science programme in the US, as ranked by US’s National Research Council. 3. Programme Requirements The programme structure comprises the modules and requirements of both the BComp in Computer Science, and the Scientiae Magister in Computer Science programmes. The details are listed here: For BComp in Computer Science Prospective Students Cohort 2010/11 Cohort 2009/10 Cohort 2008/09 For Scientiae Magister in Computer Science All Cohorts 4. Admission Requirement A. Direct Admissions Students may enter the concurrent degree programme at any point during their undergraduate study at NUS although it is preferred that they declare their interest at NUS matriculation. Candidates applying for admission to NUS can also apply for direct admission to this programme. They will be chosen on the basis of their A-level or diploma grades (or equivalent), their interest profile in computer science, and a personal interview designed to judge their potential and suitability for the programme. During their course of study at NUS, students in the programme must maintain a high level of performance as judged by a joint committee. Students who do not meet this standard will be moved to the standard Bachelor of Computing in Computer Science at NUS. Admission to the Master's degree component of the programme, granted by the Graduate School at Brown University, will be based on the student's academic performance, GRE examination scores and recommendations of the joint committee. B. In Progress Admissions Students who have not opted for direct admission, but are admitted to SoC-NUS, may also declare their interest at NUS matriculation. Selection criteria for these students will be similar to those for direct admission. Existing Bachelor of Computing in Computer Science students who have demonstrated strong academic abilities may be allowed to enter the programme at any stage of their study at NUS. These students are required to meet all the requirements of the programme. 5. Admission requirements & procedure A. Local applicants with A-level certificate or its equivalent They can apply for direct admission to this programme when they submit their undergraduate admission applications to NUS via http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/. They must obtain: H2 pass in Computing, Mathematics or Physics; OR at least a B grade in H1 Mathematics. B. Local applicants with polytechnic diplomas from Singapore At least a "B4" grade in GCE "O" level Additional Mathematics. Shortlisted students for the Concurrent Programme will be required to attend an interview and submit the documents listed below. Interviews will be held in early May. C. For candidates who have received an offer before the current admission exercise Candidates who have been given a place in the course for Computing (Computer Science courses) and joining in August 2011 may apply separately with the School for this Concurrent Programme. Please download the form here, and complete it. The deadline for submitting your documents listed below will be announced in due time. C. Required Documents and Instructions for Submission The documents required are: Academic Performance documents: Copy of A-Level consolidated results; Curriculum Vitae: concise, tabular, less than 4 pages; Statement of intent: an essay on why you are suitable for the concurrent programme; Instructions for submission of supporting documents: Please do not submit original certificates or official documents; make and send the photocopies instead. Please write your name and application number on all documents. Please enclose an English translation for any supporting document that is not in English. Please write your application number and ‘BComp-Brown’ on the top left-hand corner of the envelope. Please send the documents to:       NUS School of Computing       Office of Undergraduate Studies       The Administrator (BComp(CS)-Brown)       Computing 1 #02-05       13 Computing Drive       Singapore 117417 6. Progression Criteria Students in this concurrent programme must maintain a CAP of 4.00 or above (out of 5.00) for their BComp requirements. A student whose CAP falls below 4.00 for two consecutive semesters in NUS will not be allowed to remain in the concurrent programme, but may continue with his BComp study at NUS. 7. Award of Degrees Students must fully satisfy the concurrent BComp in Computer Sciene and the Scientiae Magister in Computer Science degree requirements before they are simultaneously conferred both degrees. Under no circumstances would a student be conferred the Brown degree before both degree requirements are fully satisfied. 8. Grading and Degree Requirement Continuation Criteria Students in this concurrent programme must maintain a CAP of 4.00 or above (out of 5.00) for their BComp requirements. Award of Degrees Students must fully satisfy the concurrent BComp in Computer Science and the Scientiae Magister in Computer Science requirements before they are simultaneously conferred both degrees. Under no circumstances would a student be conferred the Brown degree before both degree requirements are fully satisfied. 9. Tuition Fees at Brown University Students will pay Brown tuition fees during the time they undertake instruction at Brown in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the concurrent degree. They will also provide their medical insurance coverage. Applicants pursuing this concurrent programme are encouraged to take up the National Infocomm Scholarship which is offered by the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore. 10. Comparison of Tuition Fees and Duration The CDP provides excellent overseas experience at a fraction of the cost of an overseas undergraduate education and with a shorter time duration compared to doing an NUS undergraduate degree and the overseas Masters degree separately. For Singaporean students, the tuition fee for the entire CDP is approximately S$79,000. In comparison, the tuition fees for a 4 year undergraduate degree at Brown is approximately S$195,000 and the tuition fees for a 4 year undergraduate degree followed by a Masters degree at Brown is S$248,000. The typical duration of the CDP is 5 years in comparison with the total length of 6 years for doing the undergraduate and Master degree separately.Note : The information is based on estimated cost, your actual cost may be different.  Please remember that tuition fees are also subject to change   11.
