Section Descriptions & General Submission Guidelines The Features section publishes research-based articles that addressÂ  concerns in the ELT and communication skills classroom on a wide variety of topics. Areas of interest include but are not limited to successful teaching practice, syllabus and materials design, a progressive means of assessment, andÂ  approaches to teacher training. Articles should be research-based; demonstrate a link betweenÂ relevant theory and practice in the field; approximate 7000 words. The InnovationsÂ section publishes articles that describe innovative and effective classroom activities, teaching practices, approaches to curriculum design, means of assessment, and teaching and learning platforms within a specific teaching/learning context. All of these should have relevance to practitioners working in a variety of educational settings. Articles should identify the type of course, describe the level of learners, and identify their learning needs; explain the steps or the procedure involved in implementing the innovative activity, strategy, approach, test or platform; reflect an awareness of current theory and practice in the field; approximate 5000 words. The ELT Court section publishes opinion pieces that respond to controversialÂ issues that concern the ELT world. These issues can include English language grammar, vocabulary and usage, teaching pedagogy, classroom management, etc. Ideally,Â eachÂ theme will be presented with differing opinions from experts in the area.

The ELT Lives section publishes biographical sketches of people inÂ  the ELT field whose experience, ideas and/or professional contributions are noteworthy. Each article for this section is based on an interview process that seeks not only to gather descriptive information about a particular person but also to challenge that personâ€™s guiding principles and assumptions and to present the discussion in a prose and/or video format. If you have an interest in conducting an interview of such a person and presenting an article for ELT Lives, please contact the ELTWO chief editor in advance at eltwo@nus.edu.sg with a brief proposal.
