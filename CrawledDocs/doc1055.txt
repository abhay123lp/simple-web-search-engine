however, innovation and insights will continue to be driven most rapidly by single investigators. -Prof Michael Sheetz, Director, MBI Principal Investigators BALASUBRAMANIAN Mohan Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Deputy Director & Principal Investigator, Cell Division Group, Temasek Lifesciences Lab research and biographyÂ |Â mohan@tll.org.sg BERSHADSKY Alexander Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Professor, the Joseph Moss Chair of Biomedical Research, Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Inst of Science research and biography |Â alexander.bershadsky@weizmann.ac.il GROVES Jay Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Professor, Department of Chemistry and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, University of California, Berkeley research and biography |Â jtgroves@lbl.gov HEW Choy Leong Senior Advisor and Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Emeritus Professor, Department of Biological Sciences, NUS research and biography |Â dbshewcl@nus.edu.sg KANCHANAWONG Pakorn Tony Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Assistant Professor, Â Department of Biomedical Engineering, NUS research and biography |Â biekp@nus.edu.sg KENNEY Linda J Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Professor of Microbiology & Immunology, Adjunct Professor of Bioengineering, University of Illinois-Chicago research and biography |Â kenneyl@uic.edu KOH Cheng Gee Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Assistant Professor, School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University research and biography |Â cgkoh@ntu.edu.sg LADOUX Benoit Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Professor, MatiÃ¨re et SystÃ¨mes Complexes, UniversitÃ© Paris Diderot & CNRS research and biography |Â dbslb@nus.edu.sg LIM Chwee Teck Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Professor, Department of Biomedical Engineering & Department of Mechanical Engineering, NUS research and biography |Â ctlim@nus.edu.sg LOW Boon Chuan Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Department of Biological Sciences, NUS research and biography |Â dbslowbc@nus.edu.sg MATSUDAIRA Paul Co-Director and Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Professor and Head, Department of Biological Sciences, NUS research and biography |Â dbsmpt@nus.edu.sg MOTEGI Fumio Principal Investigator, MBI and Temasek Lifesciences Laboratory Assistant Professor, Department of Biological Science, NUS research and biography |Â fmotegi@tll.org.sg SAUNDERS Timothy Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Assistant Professor, Department of Biological Sciences, NUS research and biography |Â dbsste@nus.edu.sg SAWADA Yasuhiro Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Associate Professor, Department of Biological Sciences, NUS research and biography |Â dbssy@nus.edu.sg SHEETZ Michael Director and Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Distinguished Professor, Department of Biological Sciences, NUS research and biography |Â mbihead@nus.edu.sg SHIVASHANKAR G V Deputy Director and Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Associate Professor, Department of Biological Sciences, NUS research and biography |Â dbsgvs@nus.edu.sg TOYAMA Yusuke Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Assistant Professor, Department of Biological Sciences, NUS research and biography | dbsty@nus.edu.sg VIASNOFF Virgile Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Associate Professor, Mechanobiology Institute, Singapore (MBI) Charge de Recherche 1st Class CNRS/ France research and biography | Virgile.Viasnoff@espci.fr WU Min Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Assistant Professor, Department of Biological Sciences, NUS research and biography |Â dbswum@nus.edu.sg YAN Jie Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Associate Professor, Department of Physics, NUS research and biography |Â phyyj@nus.edu.sg YIM Evelyn Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Assistant Professor, Department of Biomedical Engineering and Department of Surgery, NUS research and biography |Â eyim@nus.edu.sg YU Hanry Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Professor, Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, NUS research and biography |Â phsyuh@nus.edu.sg ZAIDEL-BAR Ronen Principal Investigator, Mechanobiology Institute Assistant Professor, Department of Biomedical Engineering, NUS research and biography |Â biezbr@nus.edu.sg MBI is a home to those with the same vision- to work with the best in mechanobiology research.
