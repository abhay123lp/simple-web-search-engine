More pointedly, do they form a giant cartel to suck patronage resources from the state? Indonesian commentators almost invariably brand the country's parties as corrupt, self-absorbed, and elitist, while most scholars argue that they are poorly institutionalized. The book tests such assertions by providing unprecedented and fine-grained analysis of the inner workings of Indonesian parties, and by comparing them to their equivalents in other new democracies around the world. Contrary to much of the existing scholarship, the book finds that Indonesian parties are reasonably well institutionalized if compared to their counterparts in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and other parts of Asia. There is also little evidence that Indonesian parties are cartelized. But there is a significant flaw in the design of Indonesia's party system: while most new democracies provide state funding to parties, Indonesia has opted to deny central party boards any meaningful subsidies. As a result, Indonesian parties face severe difficulties in financing their operations, leading them to launch predatory attacks on state resources and making them vulnerable to manipulation by oligarchic interests. Â«This is a wonderful book, the best to appear on Indonesian party politics, indeed on Indonesian politics in general, since democratization more than a decade ago.Â» - R. William Liddle, Professor Emeritus of Political Science, Ohio State University> Â«I have the highest regard for Dr Mietzner. He does not sit around and ruminate from a distance. He spends a lot of time on the ground in Indonesia and has a formidable circle of sources and contacts.Â» - John McBeth, author of Reporter: Forty Years Covering Asia Marcus MIETZNER is Senior Lecturer and Fellow in the Department of Political and Social Change, School of International, Political and Strategic Studies, Australian National University. publication year: 2013 320 pages ISBN: 978-9971-69-768-6  Paperback  US$32.00  S$38.00 Our edition is available in Asia, Australia and New Zealand.        NUS Press: Home | Search | Site Map | Contact Us © Copyright 2001-07 National University of Singapore.
