LKYSPP helps its students to understand the complex issues that challenge policymakers daily and offers a strong curriculum anchored firmly within an Asian context. The courses and case studies offered in the programmes reflect a wide spectrum of issues which are unique to countries in the Asia-Pacific region and complicated by religious, ethnic, historical, and political variables which add to the complexity of governance. The Faculty of Law, on the other hand, offers rigorous training in public law, international law, and governance, and has a long history of placing its graduates in leading positions in government and public service. Our distinguished alumni include Tommy Koh â€™61 (Singapore Ambassador-At-Large at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), Chan Sek Keong â€™61 (Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Singapore), S Jayakumar â€™63 (Singapore Senior Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for National Security), K. Shanmugam, SC â€™84 (Singapore Minister for Law and Second Minister for Home Affairs), many eminent judges, Members of Parliament, diplomats, professors and law practitioners. The concurrent degree programme in Law (LLB) and Public Policy (MPP), launched in Academic Year (AY) 2007-2008, combines the strengths of the LKY School of Public Policy and the Faculty of Law, offering law students, particularly those interested in a career in public service, a unique opportunity to understand the legal, policy, and practical dimensions of governance and national, regional, and international policy-making.     LLB(Hons) and MPP Concurrent Degree Programme: Home | Search | Contact Us Â© Copyright 2001-06 National University of Singapore.
