Ten volumes of RELT have been published. In order to streamline CELC's publications, RELT has now been merged with another CELC journal, the online English Language Teaching World Online (ELTWO). ELTWO is a refereed online journal that publishes works related to the teaching and learning of English language and communication skills. The journal comprises 5 sections: Features, Innovations, ELT Court, ELT Lives, and Med1f40ia Review. Authors who were considering publishing their articles in RELT are now invited to consider ELTWO. Please refer to the Submissions Guidelines. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the RELT Editorial Review Board and contributors for their support over the years.
