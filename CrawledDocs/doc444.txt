If you are in need of financial assistance, you may login here to state the reason for your late application and proceed to apply accordingly. The University is committed to providing a quality education for all our students and to ensuring that no deserving student is denied admissions because of financial difficulty. Needy students can apply for financial aid which will be offered if they meet the eligibility criteria. Financial aid will be in the form of a financial aid package which is designed based on the recognition that a university education is a partnership involving the student, his/her family and the University. In structuring the package, an average student’s expected cost of attendance consisting of tuition fees and living expenses, is taken into account. The financial aid package that is offered may comprise a combination of loans, bursary, and work-study assistance, depending on the extent of the student’s level of neediness which is assessed based on the declared family income and mitigating factors, if any. Students who are in need of financial assistance can apply online for financial aid during the stipulated application period. Apart from such financial aid packages, NUS also administers the MOE Bursary, Donated Scholarships and other loan schemes such as the Overseas Student Exchange Programme Loan Scheme and NUS Notebook Computer Loan Scheme. In addition, full-time undergraduate students may also enquire at their respective Faculties/Departments/Programmes about part-time work opportunities to assist in teaching or research, during their period of candidature as an Undergraduate Student Tutor or Student Researcher.
