Introduction This is a fast-track programme that allows artistically talented students to obtain a Bachelor of Computing (BComp) in Computer Science (CS) degree from NUS and a Master of Entertainment Technology (MET) degree from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) within five years. Successful applicants will spend 3.5 years in NUS to complete the bachelor degree and the next 1.5 years at the Entertainment Technology Center (ETC-Global) located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, to complete the MET degree.  If the degrees were pursued separately, the BComp programme takes four years to complete, and the MET two years. Students who meet the selection criteria will be eligible to apply for the full scholarship support from the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) under its National Infocomm Scholarship (NIS) scheme. Students will also build up a portfolio of work as the programme emphasises project work, which is much valued in the interactive digital industry. Alumni of the ETC are known to be much sought after by the digital media industry, as well as by museum and theme park companies. Following the naming convention for degree programmes in the University, this programme is formally known as the Concurrent Degree Programme in Bachelor of Computing (Honours) (Communications and Media) and Master of Entertainment Technology. The programme commenced in August 2007, with an expected intake of 20 students annually. 2. Partner University: ETC of CMU Carnegie Mellon's Entertainment Technology Center (ETC of CMU) is a leading institution in the world for training in interactive digital media installations and technology. Trainees undergo a rigorous project based curriculum where they work in teams in highly creative environments. ETC currently has its headquarters in Pittsburg, USA. Trainees are encouraged to travel to interesting sites all over the world, and work with a first-hand perspective on projects. Adventurous projects often lead to start-up companies or to Ph.D. research in renowned universities. 3. Programme structure The programme structure comprises of modules and requirements from both BComp in Computer Science (CS)) programme and Master of Entertainment Technology (MET) programme. 3.1 For BComp CS programme requirements (160-MC), the programme structure will be similar to the four-year BComp (CS) for the respective cohort, except that it is compulsory for students to fulfill the following : Satisfy Interactive Media Focus Area Take CS3283 / CS3284 Media Technology Project I / II Take CP4101 BComp Dissertation 3.2 MET Programme requirements (66-MC) will comprise the following: 53-831 Building Virtual Worlds (project) 53-608 The Visual Story 53-609 Game Design 53-500 ETC Fundamentals 53-711 Improvisational Acting 53-606 ETC Interdisciplinary Project II 53-607 ETC Interdisciplinary Project III 4 ETC course-based modules   4. Selection criteria Students will be admitted directly to the Concurrent Programme during their application to undergraduate admission to NUS via http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/. Applicants must select the ‘Computing (Computer Science Courses)’ course before they can view this Concurrent Programme among the available choices. These students will be selected on the basis of their A-level or diploma grades or equivalent, and their profiles in creative projects and activities. Two interviews will be conducted, one to assess the potential and suitability of students for this Concurrent Programme (sometime in early May), and another for application of scholarship support from IDA (sometime in Jan each year).  Applicants applying for the Concurrent Programme should apply for the scholarship support directly with IDA only after they have been selected for the Concurrent Programme.  Computing students who were not granted direct entry into this Concurrent Programme but are accepted into the School as part of the general Bachelor in Computing (Computer Science) cohort may apply to the programme after their first year of studies. The call for applications will be announced to all existing students at an appropriate time. These students must demonstrate strong academic ability (gaining a CAP of 4.0 and above) and creative talent in their first year of studies with the School. They must also meet all criteria of the Concurrent Programme for BComp. Admission of these students is subjected to size constraint of the Concurrent Programme. 5.

Admission Requirements Local applicants with Singapore-Cambridge 'A' level certificate or its equivalent :  A pass in H2 Computing/Mathematics/Physics or a good pass in H1 Mathematics   Local applicants with polytechnic diplomas from Singapore : At least an A2 in GCE "O" level Elementary Mathematics or at least a "B4" grade in GCE "O" level Additional Mathematics. Applicants must first make an online application with the NUS Office of Admissions at http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/   Shortlisted students for the Concurrent Programme will be required to attend an interview and submit the documents listed below. Applicants are advised to prepare their supporting documents now for immediate submission upon receipt of the call letter for interview. Interviews will be held in April / May. B. For candidates who have received an offer before the current admission exercise Candidates who have been given a place in the course for Computing and joining in August 2013 may apply separately with the School for this Concurrent Programme.

Please enclose an English translation for any supporting document that is not in English. d. Please write your application number and ‘MET’ on the top left-hand corner of the envelope. e. Please send the documents to: NUS School of Computing Office of Undergraduate Studies The Administrator (BComp-MET) Computing 1 #02-05 13 Computing Drive Singapore 117417 6. Progression Criteria Students in the Concurrent Programme in Interactive Digital Media must maintain a CAP of 4.0 or above out of 5.0 and/or demonstrate strong creative talents. Students who fail to meet the criteria will not be allowed to remain in the Concurrent Programme, but may continue with their BComp studies at NUS. 7. Conferment In accordance with the University concurrent degree programmes arrangement, a CDP student must satisfy both degree programmes before their BComp degree can be conferred by NUS.  In NUS student record, they are considered “current students” during the semesters they are away from NUS to the partner institution.  Upon your completion of the Master programme of the CDP, students are required to notify us so that we could trigger the file for graduation for the BComp degree and conferment processes, which will follow the standard FFG and conferment timeline in NUS. 8. Comparison of Tuition Fees and Duration The CDP provides excellent overseas experience at a fraction of the cost of an overseas undergraduate education and with a shorter time duration compared to doing an NUS undergraduate degree and the overseas Masters degree separately. For Singaporean students, the tuition fee for the entire CDP is approximately S$100,000. In comparison, the tuition fees for a 4 year undergraduate degree at CMU is approximately S$220,000, and the tuition fees for a 4 year undergraduate degree followed by a Masters degree at CMU is S$320,000. The typical duration of the CDP is 5 years in comparison with the total length of 6 years for doing the undergraduate and Master degree separately. Note : This information is based on estimated cost, your actual cost may be different. Please remember that tuition fees are also subject to change. 9.
