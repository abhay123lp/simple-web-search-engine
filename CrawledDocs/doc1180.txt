Read Mr Teoís†launch speech. † This move follows calls by the Entrepreneurship Review Committee to improve the quality of local start-ups by providing them better infrastructure through development of a start-up hub†and greater access to funding. † Developing a Singapore start-up hub † Named JTC LaunchPad @ one-north, the expanded cluster comprises three blocks in a 5-hectare site located opposite Fusionopolis Phase 1, approximately the size of six football fields. The expanded cluster will house start-ups and incubators from the infocomm, media and biomedical sciences, electronics and engineering industries. † The three blocks will be transformed into a conducive environment for start-ups and incubators. It includes Blk 71, the existing building; Blk 73, a new 3-storey modularised building to house younger start-ups and incubators who require smaller spaces; Blk 79, a 5-storey building converted into a multi-tenanted facility for start-ups and incubators. † Ready by end 2014, the new cluster will provide space to some 500 start-ups and the number of entrepreneurs and other employees will rise to 2,000. This doubles the current community of 250 start-ups and over 1,000 talents in Blk 71, which was described by The Economist in their special report on tech start-ups in Jan 2014 as the worldís ìmost tightly packed entrepreneurial ecosystemî. Conducive and collaborative environment Inspired by the conducive environment seen in the Google or Facebook campuses in the Silicon Valley, one will find many cafes and food outlets in the LaunchPad for employees to gather and discuss ideas; indoor and outdoor collaborative spaces to hold meetings; as well as sports facilities for interactions and relief from work. More LaunchPads to come Future development plans in the area could potentially enlarge the community to 800 start-ups and 3,200 entrepreneurs and other employees. If LaunchPad is successful, Mr Teo says the Government hopes to replicate the concept across the island for other economic sectors. Dr Lily Chan, CEO of NUS Enterprise which also manages†Plug-In@Blk71, told the local media that sustained interest of Singaporean youths to undertake entrepreneurship is critical to the success of LaunchPad and this would require the support of the government.
