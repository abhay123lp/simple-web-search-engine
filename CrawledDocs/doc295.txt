In addition, the presence and interaction with Visiting Scholars will further enhance the experience of CELC colleagues and enrich the intellectual life of the Centre. There are two schemes under the Visiting Scholars Programme. They are (a) the Visiting Scholar scheme and (b) the Visiting Fellow sch eme. Visiting Scholar Scheme The objective of this scheme is to engage established and distinguished scholars to provide consultative service to the Centre or to engage in collaborative research with academic staff members. Visiting Scholars are engaged by invitation only. They should have a faculty appointment at their respective home institutions. Additionally, they should be established scholars with internationally recognized expertise in specific area(s) related to English Language Teaching. The number of campus visits within a year varies from one to three and may include structured or scheduled online consultation sessions with CELC academic staff members. The duration of each visit ranges from 5 days to 12 days. Visiting Scholars are provided with the following financial assistance: Return airfare via the most direct and economical route (for each visit) Accommodation at the NUS Visitorsâ€™ Lodge or a 4-star hotel Daily stipend or honorarium (to be proposed on a case-by-case basis) Visiting Fellow scheme The objective of this scheme is to provide opportunities for young scholars who are at the beginning of their academic career to be attached to the Centre for either one semester or an academic year. Visiting Fellows must have demonstrated potential for research in a specific interest area or direction that aligns with one of the key research areas of the Centre. Visiting Fellows must be attached to one or two CELC academic staff members who share the similar interest. They must assist the CELC academic staff members in a research project approved by the Centre. Specific outcomes of the research (such as publications, presentations, grant applications) may be negotiated and established between Visiting Fellows and the respective CELC staff members. Visiting Fellows may also teach one module per semester if they wish to develop their teaching portfolio. Visiting Fellows are provided with a monthly allowance of S$2,500 to S$3,000. Interested applicants must submit the following documents to the Director: Curriculum vitae List of publications and conference presentations A proposal on research work to be undertaken with CELC academic staff members Expected research outcomes and potential contributions to CELC Please forward the application to The Director Centre for English Language Communication National University of Singapore 10 Architecture Drive 117511 Singapore Email: elcbox1@nus.edu.sg CELC Visiting Scholar AY11/12 Professor George Engelhard, Jr. Ph.D. Emory University Dr. George Engelhard, Jr. is a professor of educational measurement and policy, as well as Director of Graduates Studies in the Division of Educational Studies at Emory University (1985 to present).
