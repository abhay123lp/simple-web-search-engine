Treatment centers help addicts and their families through drug/alcohol detox and rehab. Most treatment centers also help those suffering with dual diagnosis (where a substance addiction and a mental health disorder occur simultaneously). It is very important to find a good treatment center that specializes in treating the specific types of addiction and the type of individual that needs to overcome the addiction. If an addiction to prescription drugs or narcotic drugs is the problem, then the treatment center may use a strategy and methodology that greatly differs from that used for alcohol addiction detox and rehab. Each individual also responds differently to different types of addiction treatment. For this reason, it is essential that the treatment center performs an in-person evaluation and determines205f the most appropriate treatment program for each person. Proper planning of the addiction recovery program is critical to success rates and minimizing relapse.
