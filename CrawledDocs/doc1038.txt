This is a four-year direct honours programme which offers a common two-year broad-based inter-disciplinary curriculum where all students will read modules in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Accounting, Marketing, Decision Science, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Computer Science and Information Systems. Students in their third and fourth years of study may choose elective modules from two lists of either functional or methodological elective modules. Functional elective modules span business functions or sectors of marketing, retailing, logistics, healthcare, etc. Methodological elective modules include those related to big data techniques, statistics, text mining, data mining, social network analysis, econometrics, forecasting, operations research, etc. In sum, these elective modules span the most exciting and challenging areas of business analytics practice in the industry today. University Scholars Programme (Business Analytics) Students in the University Scholars Programme (USP) who choose the Bachelor of Science (Business Analytics) degree programme will do so with the following variations: They will not be required to read IS2101 Business and Technical Communication in the Core modules requirement. It is replaced by USP Foundation module of Writing and Critical Thinking. They will read the UROP module (CP3208) in place of the Business Analytics Capstone Project module (BT3101) in the Core modules requirement. CP3208 is an independent study module (ISM) which will be counted as 1 USP Inquiry module in the Sciences and Technologies domain. They will not be required to read University Level Requirements (20 MCs). These are replaced by the 3 USP Inquiry modules and 2 USP Foundation modules (Quantitative Reasoning and University Scholars Seminar). They will not be required to read Unrestricted Electives (20 MCs). These are replaced by the USP Reflection module of Senior Seminar and 4 USP Inquiry modules. In summary, the breakdown of 12 USP modules will fit into these MCs requirement categories: Core: 1 Foundation module (Writing and Critical Thinking replacing IS2101), 1 Inquiry module (CP3208/USP-ISM replacing BT3101) ULR: 3 Inquiry modules and 2 Foundation modules UE: 1 Reflection module and 4 Inquiry modules Summary of degree requirements for BSc (Business Analytics) Level Programme Reqirements Cummulative MCs 1000/2000 Core modules (64 MCs) ACC1002X Financial Accounting MKT1003X Marketing EC1301 Principles of Economics MA1311 Matrix Algebra and Applications, or MA1101R Linear Algebra I1 MA1521 Calculus for Computing, or MA1102R Calculus1 CS1010 Programming Methodology CS1020 Data Structures and Algorithms I IS1103 Computing and Society IS1105 Strategic IT Applications IS1112 E-Business Essentials IE2110 Operations Research I2, or DSC3214 Introduction To Optimisation ST2131 Probability ST2132 Mathematical Statistics IS2101 Business and Technical Communication New multi-disciplinary modules: BT1101 Introduction to Business Analytics* BT2101 IT and Decision Making* 64 MCs 16 x 4 MCs of which: 11 Level 1000 modules 5 Level 2000 modules   3000/4000 Core modules (20 MCs) DSC3215 Stochastic Models in Management ST3131 Regression Analysis IS4240 Business Intelligence Systems New multi-disciplinary modules: BT3101 Business Analytics Capstone Project* BT3102 Computational Methods for Business Analytics* 84 MCs 5 x 4 MCs of which: 4 Level 3000 modules 1 Level 4000 modules   FY Project (12 MCs) Elective modules (24 MCs) Elective modules (24 MCs) BT4101 B.Sc.
