Translated by Dave McRae This groundbreaking book shows with rare clarity that Indonesia's current terrorist problems have a long and complex history. Based on a remarkable array of sources, many of which have never before been publicly cited, Solahudin's rigorous account fills many gaps in our knowledge of jihadist groups, how they interacted with the state and events abroad, and why they at times resorted to extreme violence, such as the 2002 Bali bombings. Available for the first time in English in this translation by Dave McRae, The Roots of Terrorism in Indonesia is an in-depth investigation of the development of jihadism from the earliest years of Indonesian independence to the terrorist bombings of the past decade. Â«The most complete account by far of the development of jihadism.Â» -Greg Fealy, ANU Â«This book has become something of a phenomenon in Indonesia ... Perhaps the only person to have a sharp negative reaction to it so far is a JI leader - who was hurt because he wasn't interviewed.Â» -Sidney Jones, Indonesia analyst SOLAHUDIN is a Researcher and Journalist, and a leading expert on the jihadi movement in Indonesia.
