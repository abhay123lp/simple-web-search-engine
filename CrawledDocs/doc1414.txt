The Schoolâ€™s mission is to educate and train future generations of policy-makers and leaders in Asia. It aims to be a global centre of excellence in public policy teaching and research, particularly in the principles and practices of good governance relevant to Asian societies, and the economic and social policy challenges faced by developing, transitional and newly industrialised countries.

In fact, 52 percent of the global population who lacks access to improved water facilities lives here in Asia. Thanks to Temasek Foundationâ€™s generous gift, we hope to develop a new generation of water leaders who will address this inequality through new ideas and technologies. â€“ Professor Seetharam Kallidaikurichi, Director , Institute of Water Policy (IWP), a leading water policy think-tank at the National University of Singaporeâ€™s (NUS) Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKY School). The Temasek Foundation, a non-profit philanthropic organisation that supports human and social capital development in Asia, made a gift to fund the Temasek Foundation Water Leadership Programme that will train 700 water leaders in Asia over the next 10 years to ensure improved access to life-saving water and sanitation facilities in the continentâ€™s emerging markets.
