English Assist is a paid consultancy service, set up for NUS expatriate staff from non-English speaking countries. Objectives The consultancy service has the following objectives: help clients maximise the clarity and effectiveness of their oral communication for pedagogical purposes; help clients further develop their confidence and effectiveness in communication in their professional field. Format Each programme consists of 20 hours of face-to-face consultation, spread over a semester. For the first consultation, the client and consultant analyse samples of the client's oral and written communication to determine the client's pre-course language and communication profile. Items from the pre-course profile become the basis for structuring the remaining consultations. At the end of the programme, the client and consultant together draw up the client's post-course language and communication profile. If the need arises, post-course consultancy service can be arranged in the following semester, when the client may cb7call on his/her consultant for additional help. The unique feature of English Assist is that it offers each client a personal language programme specially designed for his/her specific language and communication requirements. English Assist is offered three times a year â€“ Semester 1, Semester 2 and Special Term. Applications should reach CELC by the first week of July for Semester 1; the first week of November for Semester 2; and the first week of April for the Special Term.   © Copyright 2001- National University of Singapore.
