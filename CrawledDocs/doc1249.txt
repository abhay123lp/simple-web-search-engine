Surveillance for oseltamivir resistance is routinely performed to ensure the ongoing efficacy of oseltamivir against circulating viruses. Since the emergence of the pandemic 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus (A(H1N1)pdm09), the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses that are oseltamivir resistant (OR) has generally been low. type:  Journal Paper journal:  PLOS Pathogens, April 2014, Vol. 10, Issue 4, doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004065 pubmed:  24699865 Url:  http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1004065 Impact Factor:  8.136 Date of acceptance:  2014-02-27 Authors:  BUTLER J HOOPER HK PETRIE S MAURER-STROH S REH L GUARNACCIA T BAAS C XUE L VITESNIK S LEANG SK MCVERNON J KELSO A BARR IG MCCAW JM BLOOM JD HURT AC Research Group:  Protein Sequence Analysis Biomolecular Function Discovery Read more Human Finger-Prick Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Facilitate the Development of Stem Cell Banking Published date : Wed, 2014-03-19 Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from somatic cells of patients can be a good model for studying human diseases and for future therapeutic regenerative medicine. Current initiatives to establish human iPSC (hiPSC) banking face challenges in recruiting large numbers of donors with diverse diseased, genetic, and phenotypic representations. In this study, we describe the efficient derivation of transgene-free hiPSCs from human finger-prick blood. Finger-prick sample collection can be performed on a "do-it-yourself" basis by donors and sent to the hiPSC facility for reprogramming. type:  Journal Paper journal:  Stem Cells Translational Medicine, Mar 19, 2014, doi: 10.5966/sctm.2013-0195 pubmed:  24646489 Url:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646489 Date of acceptance:  2014-01-17 Authors:  TAN HK TOH CX MA D YANG B LIU TM LU J WONG CW TAN TK SYN C TAN EL LIM B LIM Yoon-Pin COOK SA LOH YH Read more R-loops in proliferating cells but not in the brain: implications for AOA2 and other autosomal recessive ataxias Published date : Mon, 2014-03-17 Disruption of the Setx gene, defective in ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2) leads to the accumulation of DNA/RNA hybrids (R-loops), failure of meiotic recombination and infertility in mice. We report here the presence of R-loops in the testes from other autosomal recessive ataxia mouse models, which correlate with fertility in these disorders. R-loops were coincident in cells showing high basal levels of DNA double strand breaks and in those cells undergoing apoptosis. type:  Journal Paper journal:  PLOS One, March 2014, Vol. 9, Issue 3, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0090219 pubmed:  24637776 Url:  http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0090219 Impact Factor:  3.73 Date of acceptance:  2014-01-27 Authors:  YEO Abrey BECHEREL Olivier LUFF John CULLEN Jason WONGSURAWAT Thidathip JENJAROENPUN Piroon KUZNETSOV Vladimir MCKINNON Peter LAVIN Martin Research Group:  Computational Analysis of Genome Complexity Genome and Gene Expression Data Analysis Read more Playing hide and seek: how glycosylation of the influenza virus hemagglutinin can modulate the immune response to infection Published date : Fri, 2014-03-14 Seasonal influenza A viruses (IAV) originate from pandemic IAV and have undergone changes in antigenic structure, including addition of glycans to the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. The viral HA is the major target recognized by neutralizing antibodies and glycans have been proposed to shield antigenic sites on HA, thereby promoting virus survival in the face of widespread vaccination and/or infection. type:  Journal Paper journal:  Viruses 2014 Mar 14;6(3) Pg. 1294-1316. doi: 10.3390/v6031294 pubmed:  24638204 Url:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=24638204 Impact Factor:  2.509 Date of acceptance:  2014-03-07 Authors:  TATE Michelle JOB Emma DENG Yi-Mo GUNALAN Vithiagaran MAURER-STROH Sebastian READING Patrick Research Group:  Protein Sequence Analysis Biomolecular Function Discovery Read more Drugging the p53 pathway: understanding the route to clinical efficacy Published date : Fri, 2014-03-14 The tumour suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer, with more than half of all human tumours carrying mutations in this particular gene. Intense efforts to develop drugs that could activate or restore the p53 pathway have now reached clinical trials. The first clinical results with inhibitors of MDM2, a negative regulator of p53, have shown efficacy but hint at on-target toxicities. Here, we describe the current state of the development of p53 pathway modulators and new pathway targets that have emerged. type:  Journal Paper journal:  Nature Reviews Drug Discovery Vol. 13, March 2014, Pg 217-235 2014, doi: 10.1038/nrd4236 Url:  http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v13/n3/full/nrd4236.html Impact Factor:  33.078 Authors:  KHOO Kian Hoe VERMA Chandra LANE David Research Group:  Atomistic Simulations and Design in Biology Biomolecular Modeling and Design Read more A GPU accelerated algorithm for 3D Delaunay triangulation Published date : Fri, 2014-03-14 We propose the first algorithm to compute the 3D Delaunay triangulation (DT) on the GPU. Our algorithm uses massively parallel point insertion followed by bilateral flipping, a powerful local operation in computational geometry. Although a flipping algorithm is very amenable to parallel processing and has been employed to construct the 2D DT and the 3D convex hull on the GPU, to our knowledge there is no such successful attempt for constructing the 3D DT. type:  Conference Paper/Poster journal:  ACM/SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games, 2 14-16 March 2014, San Francisco, USA Date of acceptance:  2013-12-09 Authors:  CAO Thanh-Tung NANJAPPA Ashwin GAO Mingcen TAN Tiow-Seng Research Group:  Machine Learning For Bioimage Analysis Imaging Informatics Read more Holistic View on the Extended Substrate Specificities of Orthologous Granzymes Published date : Mon, 2014-03-10 As proteases sculpt the proteome in both homeostatic and pathogenic processes, unraveling their primary signaling pathways and key substrates is of utmost importance. Hence, with the development of procedures enriching for proteolysis-indicative peptides and the availability of more sensitive mass spectrometers, protease degradomics technologies are ideally suited to gain insight into a protease's substrate repertoire and substrate-specificity profile. type:  Journal Paper journal:  Journal of Proteome Research, 2014, March 10 pubmed:  24555507 Url:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555507 Impact Factor:  5.056 Authors:  PLASMAN Kim MAURER-STROH Sebastian GEVAERT Kris VAN DAMME Petra Research Group:  Protein Sequence Analysis Biomolecular Function Discovery Read more Quantitative Protein Localization Signatures Reveal an Association between Spatial and Functional Divergences of Proteins Published date : Thu, 2014-03-06 Protein subcellular localization is a major determinant of protein function. However, this important protein feature is often described in terms of discrete and qualitative categories of subcellular compartments, and therefore it has limited applications in quantitative protein function analyses. Here, we present Protein Localization Analysis and Search Tools (PLAST), an automated analysis framework for constructing and comparing quantitative signatures of protein subcellular localization patterns based on microscopy images. type:  Journal Paper journal:  PLOS Computational Biology, March 2014, Vol. 10, Issue 3, doi : 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003504 Url:  http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1003504 Impact Factor:  4.867 Date of acceptance:  2014-01-22 Authors:  LOO Lit-Hsin LAKSAMEETHANASAN Danai TUNG Yi-Lung Research Group:  Complex Cellular Phenotype Analysis Imaging Informatics Read more The magnitude and risk factors of intestinal parasitic infection in relation to Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection and immune status, at ALERT Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Published date : Tue, 2014-03-04 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and intestinal parasitic infections are among the main health problems in developing countries like Ethiopia. Particularly, co-infections of these diseases would worsen the progression of HIV to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The purpose of this study was to determine the magnitude and risk factors for intestinal parasites in relation to HIV infection and immune status. type:  Journal Paper journal:  Parasitology International, 2014, Vol. 63, Pg 555-556, doi: 10.1016/j.parint.2014.02.002 pubmed:  24603288 Url:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603288 Date of acceptance:  2014-03-22 Authors:  TAYE Biruhalem DESTA Kassu EJIGU Selamawit DORI Geme Urge Research Group:  Protein Sequence Analysis Biomolecular Function Discovery Read more Automated Breast Tissue Density Assessment Using High Order Regional Texture Descriptors in Mammography Published date : Sat, 2014-02-15 Breast cancer is the most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer death among women in the US. The relative survival rate is lower among women with a more advanced stage at diagnosis. Early detection through screening is vital. Mammography is the most widely used and only proven screening method for reliably and effectively detecting abnormal breast tissues. In particular, mammographic density is one of the strongest breast cancer risk factors, after age and gender, and can be used to assess the future risk of disease before individuals become symptomatic. type:  Conference Paper/Poster journal:  Proceedings of SPIE Medical Imaging 2014: Computer-Aided Diagnosis, Vol. 9035, 15-20 Feb 2014, doi:10.1117/12.2043332 Url:  http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1852206 Authors:  LAW Yan Nei LIENG Monica LI Jingmei KHOO Aik Aun Research Group:  Computer Vision and Pattern Discovery Imaging Informatics Read more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 â¦ next âº last Â»
