As parents, you can make the whole new experience of learning new things and making friends a meaningful one for your child. Watch this video on how you can help your child transit to Primary One. Programme for Active Learning (PAL) Learning will continue to expand beyond the four walls of a classroom. The new Programme for Active Learning (PAL) will give your child the chance to discover new interests, learn new skills and build his character, besides providing opportunities for him to develop confidence and forge new friendships. For two hours a week, your child will have the opportunity to try out activities in the areas of sports and outdoor education, as well as performing and visual arts activities. These will take place within curriculum time. PAL modules are experiential in nature and incorporate learning in a creative, fun, and enjoyable way. Teachers and students have seen positive changes since the implementation of PAL. These include pupils becoming more confident and vocal in class, exhibiting more leadership qualities and learning to be more mindful of the needs of classmates. What Will Primary Education Be Like For My Child? The primary school years are an important phase in your childâ€™s education. It lays the foundation for his learning and development later on in life. The primary school curriculum is designed for a well-rounded learning experience and focuses on three main aspects of education: (1) A range of subjects comprising Languages, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, Art & Crafts, and Music to develop a good grounding in subjects across different areas of study. (2) Knowledge skills which focus on developing your childâ€™s thinking, process and communication skills. Knowledge skills are taught through a variety of subjects. (3) Character Development which focuses on instilling sound values in your child, to take him through life as a responsible adult. Your child will have many opportunities to develop life skills through Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs), Civics and Moral Education, Social Emotional Learning, National Education and Physical Education.
