It excludes information that: (i) is publicly known or available from other sources who are not under a confidentiality obligation to the source of the information; (ii) subsequently becomes public by publication or other means through no action or fault of the University; (iii) has been lawfully received from a third party without a breach of this privacy statement; (iv) is already known by or available to the University without a confidentiality obligation; (v) is disclosed with prior written approval of the student; or (vi) is required to be disclosed under the law or pursuant to a court order. Without affecting the generality of paragraph (1) and for the avoidance of doubt, the following shall be deemed to meet the requirement for disclosure stated in paragraph (1) above: A request for information by the Ministry of Education; Sharing of information or data with Government agencies or statutory bodies or non-government agencies authorised to carry out specific Government services or duties; Sharing of information with persons or organizations providing a student with financial aid; Sharing of information with third parties, including members of the student’s family or medical or security personnel, in an emergency if the University deems it necessary in order to protect the health or safety of the student or other persons; or Publication or release of information that is customary by universities or other educational institutions, including but not limited to awards of prizes, medals, scholarships, classes of honours and other marks of distinction, and student or graduation status. Access to Confidential Student Information for purposes other than those based on an official or educational interest may also be granted at the discretion of the University, provided that a student has provided his or her consent for such disclosure. A student may provide such consent in his or her Acceptance Record at the time of his or her admission to the University. For the convenience of students, the University may also display to individual students data that the individual student had previously supplied to the University or other Government agencies. In the event that a student provides consent (in the manner set out at paragraph (3) above) for the disclosure or use of information other than for an official or educational purpose, the University will retain a student's personal data only as necessary for the effective delivery of University services to the student. To safeguard a student's personal data that had been provided electronically or had been converted into an electronic form, the University has taken reasonable steps to secure all electronic storage and transmission of personal data with appropriate security technologies. This Policy is subject to any applicable law mandating or otherwise requiring disclosure. If you have any questions or concerns with regard to the Privacy Statement, please click here. This Policy is subject to revision at the discretion of the University from time to time.       © Copyright 2001-2011 National University of Singapore. All Rights Reserved.
