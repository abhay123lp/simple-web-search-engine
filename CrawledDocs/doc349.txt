Even today's encrypted data is vulnerable to technological progress. What privacy is ultimately possible? In the 27 March issue of Nature, the weekly international journal of science, CQT's Director Artur Ekert and Renato Renner review what physics tells us about keeping our secrets secret.

Abstract: Correlations that violate a Bell Inequality are said to be nonlocal, i.e. they do not admit a local and deterministic explanation. Great effort has been devoted to study how the amount of nonlocality (as measured by a Bell inequality violation) serves to quantify the amount of randomness present in observed correlations. In this work we reverse this research program and ask what do the randomness certification capabilities of a theory tell us about the nonlocality of that theory. We find that, contrary to initial intuition, maximally nonlocal theories cannot allow maximal randomness certification. We go on and show that quantum theory, in contrast, permits certification of maximal randomness in all dichotomic scenarios. We hence pose the question of whether quantum theory is optimal for randomness, i.e. is it the most nonlocal theory that allows maximal randomness certification? We answer this question in the negative by identifying a larger-than-quantum set of correlations capable of this feat. Not only are these results relevant to understanding quantum mechanicsâ€™ fundamental features, but also put fundamental restrictions on device-independent protocols based on the no-signaling principle. CQT Talk by Guillermo Romero, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU — Mon 14 Apr, 2:00 PM CQT Talk by Guillermo Romero, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU Date/Time: Monday, 14 Apr at 2:00 pm Venue: CQT Level 3 Seminar Room, S15-03-15 Title: Fermion-fermion scattering with superconducting circuits Abstract: In this talk, I will present the quantum simulation of scalar fermionic field modes interacting via a continuum of bosonic modes with superconducting circuits. Unlike many quantum technologies and different proposals of quantum simulations of quantum field theories, superconducting circuits offer naturally the continuum of bosonic modes by means of one-dimensional transmission lines, or low-quality resonators with a well defined bandwidth. Our proof-of-principle proposal considers a family of interacting Hamiltonians in 1+1 dimensions, that can be implemented within the state-of-the-art circuit QED technology. Here, the fermionic modes are encoded in superconducting transmon qubits, in a scalable approach that may lead to a full-fledged quantum simulation of quantum field theories. CQT PhD Thesis Oral Defense by Nick Lewty, CQT — Tue 15 Apr, 4:00 PM CQT PhD Thesis Oral Defense by Nick Lewty, CQT Date/Time: Tuesday, 15 Apr at 4:00 pm Venue: CQT Level 3 Conference Room, S15-03-15 Title: Experimental determination of nuclear magnetic octupole moment of 137 Ba + ion Abstract: We perform precision measurements on the 5D5/2 manifold hyperfine intervals of a single trapped ion, 137 Ba+. RF spectroscopy is used to measure the hyperfine intervals to an accuracy of a few Hz. Our results provide a three orders of magnitude improvement in accuracy over previous work and also provide a 10-fold improvement in the value of gJ for this level. These results complement our previous work on the 5D3/2 manifold of 137Ba+, providing an independent measurement of the nuclear octupole, and a consistency check on atomic structure calculations. CQT Talk by Luigi Amico, Univ. Catania — Thu 17 Apr, 4:00 PM CQT Talk by Luigi Amico, Univ. Catania Date/Time: Thursday, 17 Apr at 4:00 pm 18cdVenue: CQT Level 3 Seminar Room, S15-03-15 Title: Entanglement transition in quantum magnets Abstract: Entanglement is a defining feature of quantum mechanics that in recent years has led to the development of a new discipline of quantum statistical mechanics: Entanglement in many-body systems. Its application to spin systems predicts a new type of zero temperature transition in an applied magnetic field at which the nature of the entanglement qualitatively changes without any anomaly in the ground state energy of the system. I will discuss the correlations near such an entanglement transition. I will discuss the first attempts to observe the phenomenon with a neutron scattering experiment in a one dimensional quantum magnet.
