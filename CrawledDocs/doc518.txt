Since 2011, scholars have embarked on trips to Cambodia and Indonesia as volunteers for the Water for Life and Words on Wheels Projects launched by the Singapore International Foundation under their Direct Service Projects. The Water for Life Project aims to bring clean drinking water to villages and in doing so, reduce the mortality rate attributed to water-borne diseases and enhance the overall quality of life for people in developing communities. Scholars were involved in work such as the installation of bio-sand water filters to designated village households. The Words on Wheels Project is a mobile library project which aims to help local communities develop educational activities and promote a culture of reading and self-learning. Scholars conducted reading, storytelling and other English learning activities to enrich the experiences of participating students.   Freshmen Orientation Camp In AY2013, a group of senior scholars organised an orientation camp for the first time for freshmen scholars. The camp aimed to provide a platform for NUS Scholars to network and bond, and to foster in them a stronger sense of identity. During the camp, freshmen scholars experienced a series of outdoor activities at the Kota Rainforest Resort in Kota Tinggi, and went away with some personal development and teambuilding skills as well as new friends amongst their peers.Â  NUS-LEAD Programme NUS-LEAD programme, conducted by the NUS Career Centre, is designed to develop the leadership potential of NUS students, help identify their strengths as well as address many of the key challenges faced by 21st century societies. NUS Scholars participated in the programme and the series of practical workshops taught by a highly qualified trainer, to help equip scholars with knowledge on areas such as leadership and authenticity, communications, influencing and leading teams, global intelligence and project management skills.   Back-to-School Party In January 2014, NUS Scholars organised a Back-to-School Barbeque before the beginning of the new academic semester. Initiated by the scholars, the event provided an opportunity for interaction amongst the scholars, to help build a more cohesive NUS Scholars community.       © Copyright 2001-2013 National University of Singapore.
