From a fledgling college, NUS has developed into an institution considered by many to be among the best in the world. Our transformative education and high impact research are aimed at making a distinctive and positive impact on society. We hope you will be inspired by the many fascinating facets that make NUS a leading global university centred in Asia, and a community that will influence the future.
