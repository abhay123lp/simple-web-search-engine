Goodman & Elizabeth Schultz Bearing witness to the encounters of American soldiers and Japanese civilians in the aftermath of a savage war, the memoir of Mrs Yumi Goto is poignant testimony to the capacity of ordinary people for mutual curiousity, learning and generosity. In the summer of 1945, a contingent of 1,800 American soldiers was posted as a garrison force in the country town of Muramatsu, where they lived alongside a community feeling "depressed and fearful" at the prospect of foreign occupation. Mrs Goto, an English-speaking graduate of one of Japan's top universities for women, had relocated to Muramatsu with her family after their house in Tokyo was destroyed in a bombing raid. She became an interpreter while the Americans were in Muramatsu, and recorded light-hearted but perceptive observations of the Japanese-American encounter. Written in English for an American audience who "would like to read how their young men behaved in Japan", and revealing "their thoughts and sentiments of a 26-year-old girl in war-devastated Japan', her memoir is a charming and uplifting account of a woman's journey, and how ordinary people from very different backgrounds found common ground in difficult circumstances. Yumi GOTO was born in 1918 and now makes her home in Tokyo. Explaining why she wrote her memoir in English, she said she felt that â€œthe Japanese people, once the Occupation would be over in the future, would not want to recall the memories of the period when the nation was humiliated but that Americans would like to read how their young men behaved in Japanâ€?. publication year: 2014 174 pages ISBN: 978-9971-69-793-8  Paperback  US$24.00  S$28.00        NUS Press: Home | Search | Site Map | Contact Us © Copyright 2001-09 National University of Singapore.
