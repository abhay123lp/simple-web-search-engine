A goldfish peddler installing aquariums, a business school graduate selling shoes on the sidewalk, a college student running an extensive multi-level sales network, and a girl doing promotions but intent on moving into management, are just a few of the people profiled. Based on frank and freewheeling interviews conducted by students, the book engages a broad range of Vietnamese, both living in Vietnam and abroad, on their feelings about work, life and getting ahead. By providing a ground-level view of the texture of daily working life in the midst of rapid and unsettling change, the book reveals Vietnam today as a place where ordinary people are leveraging whatever assets they have, not just to survive, but to make a better life for themselves, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. "Highly Recommended": Choice, March 2014 Â«It's a Living gives voice to 67 Vietnamese works from all walks of life. The respondents paint vivid pictures of their daily routines and the particular rewards and challenges of each career path. The short chapters are balanced between people who take pleasure in their work and those who are mostly there for the pay check. Apparently ordinary jobs, such as factory work, farmer and bank employee, are interspersed with more offbeat occuptions, from grey hair plucker to rat catcher. Interviews touch on issues of corruption and arbitrary enforcement of regulations; they also reveal the importance of education and aspirations of the Vietnamese for their children. A short introduction sets out the book's major themes, but readers would benefit from more about Vietnamese socialism and how much workers have to pay toward the cost of education, health care and retirement ... This book is a wonderful, evocative read for undergraduates or anyone with an interest in the people of Vietnam. Beautiful photos allow many of the book's personalities to shine through.Â» -Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries Â«... vividly illuminates the intersection between processes of social and economic transformation and the everyday ...
