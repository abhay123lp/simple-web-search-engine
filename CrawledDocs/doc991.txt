b6 403 Forbidden Access Deniedfe Sadly, your client does not supply a proper User-Agent, and is consequently excluded. We have an inordinate number of problems with automated scripts which do not supply a User-Agent, and violate the automated access guidelines posted at 101arxiv.org -- hence we now exclude them all. (In rare cases, we have found that accesses through proxy servers strip the User-Agent information. If this is the case, you need to contact the administrator of your proxy server to get it fixed.)144 If you believe this determination to be in error, seehttp://4aarxiv.org/denied.html for additional information.
