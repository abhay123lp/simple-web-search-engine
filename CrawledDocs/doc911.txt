There will be adjustments made to the tuition fees for AY2014/2015. A schedule of the graduate tuition fees can be found at https://share.nus.edu.sg/registrar/info/gd/GDTuitionCurrent.pdf Back to top   Q02. How much can we expect the fee increment to be? Fees for the incoming AY2014/2015 intake of students for graduate coursework programmes, with the exception of graduate courses offered by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, will be adjusted upwards by 8%. The tuition fees for graduate coursework degrees offered by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy will be adjusted upwards by 15%. In subsequent years, the fees for the AY2014/2015 intake will be increased by 3% annually for the remaining course duration. Fees for the incoming AY2014/2015 intake of students for graduate research programmes will be adjusted upwards by 10%. In subsequent years, the fees for the AY2014/15 intake will be increased by 3% annually for the remaining course duration.Existing graduate students from the earlier intakes will also see an annual 3% increase for the remaining course duration. Back to top   Q03. What are the reasons for the proposed fee adjustments? Tuition fees paid by students are channelled towards enhancing the educational quality and offerings, and the student experience at the NUS. The University is committed to delivering and upholding a high quality of education. We are continually improving and expanding on our educational offerings, and we have over the years introduced many interesting options and differentiated academic pathways for our students. We are also constantly innovating to improve the student experience and develop a nurturing and conducive learning environment at NUS. The NUS University Town is home to Singapore's first residential colleges, where students can explore an immersive residential living and learning experience. We are also continually improving our student-faculty ratios across the university. A modest tuition fee increase is necessary to help preserve and improve the quality of teaching, and to enable NUS and its Faculties to cope with the reality of the cost of education - a higher cost of operations arising from higher prices of supplies and services. Back to top   Q04. Have cost cutting measures been considered? Keeping costs under control is always a top priority for the University. Through streamlining of administrative processes, and competitive tendering for goods and services, NUS has managed to keep fee increases low. Back to top   Q05. Which set of fees would be applicable if I have accepted NUSâ€™ offer of admission earlier and been granted deferment of my actual admission to August 2014 (AY2014/2015)? You will be considered a new student of the AY2014/2015 intake. As such, the fees for "new students admitted in AY2014/2015", as published on the graduate fee webpage, will apply to you. Back to top   Q06. How will these changes affect fees charged to international students? New Singapore Permanent Residents (PR) and International Students (IS) admitted to NUS from AY2014/2015 will pay higher fees. The higher fee differentiation is in line with the Government's move to, over time, sharpen the differentiation between Singapore Citizens (SC), PR and foreigners to reflect the privileges of citizenship. For the student cohort to be admitted in AY2014/2015, PR in affected courses will pay higher fees of between $900 and $2,000 more than the existing annual rates, and IS who are under the Service Obligation Scheme for graduate students will pay between $1,300 and $2,900 more than existing annual rates. Existing students will continue to be subject to the current fee differentiation framework that was applied to them. Back to top   Q07. With the tuition fee increase for AY2014/2015, will there be any enhancements made to the programmes? The implementation of this increase and thorough cost-cutting measures will enable NUS to press ahead with significant enhancements to our educational programmes. The University will continue to attract the best faculty, staff and students to further propel NUS to the forefront of research and education. With additional faculty, improvement in the number of students to each faculty member can be expected and further enhancements will be made to several student-related services such as career and academic counselling services. Back to top   Q08. Can we expect financial assistance or scholarships to help students with the fee increase? Students can apply for a range of scholarships and financial aid from the University and the Ministry of Education. These options include NUS Research Scholarship, President's Graduate Fellowship, SMA Graduate Fellowship at SMART, Lee Kong Chian Graduate Scholarship, NUS Research Studentship, NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences & Engineering Scholarship (NGS Scholarship), Singapore International Graduate Award (SINGA), NUS Graduate Scholarship for ASEAN Nationals (NUS GSA), Tuition Fee Allowance, and Tuition Fee Loan. More information on graduate scholarships and financial aid can be found at http://www.nus.edu.sg/admissions/graduate-studies/fees-faid-scholarships.php. The University will continue to expend every effort to source for more scholarship funds to award deserving students. Back to top   Q09. Would NUS provide more on-campus job opportunities for students, including international students, to cope with the fee adjustments? Besides the Part-time Appointment Scheme, the NUS Career Centre in the Office of Student Affairs provides services to help students find part-time jobs on and outside campus. Students who are interested are invited to check with the NUS Career Centre, or directly with the Faculties, and Departments for such part-time job opportunities. Research scholars are not allowed to accept any form of employment, whether or not he/she is remunerated, except for departmental work in NUS for which they may be remunerated, without prior written approval from the University. Full-time international students who are NOT scholarship holders may work on a part-time basis during the period of their candidature. However, their part-time work must not exceed 16 hours of work per week during official school term. For full-time research students who wish to work more than 16 hours per week during vacation time, they would have to obtain prior approval from the respective Faculty/School. Back to top   Q10. With the increased pressures in workload and expectations from graduate students, would NUS consider scholarship extensions for graduate students exceeding their academic term? The Faculties consider requests for extension of candidature and scholarship on a case-by-case basis. Factors that are taken into consideration include the reason(s) for extension, and the performance of the student. Nonetheless, upon extension of candidature, there is no guarantee of similar extension of scholarship and government subsidy. Back to top   Q11. For those who are staying for extra months not amounting to a complete semester, are there any considerations for lowered / discounted fees? Currently, graduate research students are given a full waiver of their tuition fees if they submit their theses within the first two instructional weeks of the start of a semester and a 50% discount if their theses are submitted by end September in Semester 1 or end March in Semester 2. Back to top   Q12. If I already have a graduate degree, will I still be able to enjoy the government subsidy if I wish to pursue a second graduate programme? Students who have previously enjoyed government subsidy or sponsorship by a Singapore government agency (such as scholarships offered by the Ministries, Public Service Commission and Statutory Boards) in a graduate programme will not be eligible for government subsidy in another graduate programme at the same or lower level. For example, a student with a subsidised Master's degree will have to pay a higher fee without MOE subsidy, if he/she is embarking on another subsidised Master's programme. In the event that the student is upgraded to PhD in the midst of his/her degree, depending on the date of the upgrading, he/she will be eligible for subsidy from the semester of the upgrading or the following semester. Students who are not eligible for government subsidy are also ineligible for most of the scholarships. With effect from AY2008/2009 Semester 2, students (all nationalities) who did not complete an earlier graduate programme and are now re-admitted to another/same graduate programme within NUS or across the Autonomous Universities (NTU, SMU and SUTD) will be eligible for MOE subsidy only up to the normal course duration for the new programme less the equivalent number of semesters of government subsidy/scholarship received for the previous programme.

Existing students will continue to be subject to the current fee differentiation framework that was applied to them.  © Copyright 2001-2011 National University of Singapore. All Rights Reserved.
