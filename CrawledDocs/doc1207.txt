Where the classroom is theory, the residential and co-curricular experience is practice. Yale-NUS students will be randomly placed into one of three Residential Colleges, each with its own dining hall, buttery, common rooms, study spaces, live-in professors, seminar spaces, and social traditions. This residential model creates â€˜nested communitiesâ€™ in the Yale tradition of supporting lifelong learning in liberal arts and science by combining academic, intellectual, social, athletic, and artistic life. As you and your peers pursue a rich student-directed co-curricular life of student government, clubs, organizations, arts, and athletics, you will build your independence and leadership skills, while achieving mental agility and strength of mind. On campus you will have frequent opportunities to interact with your professors, as well as visiting speakers, artists, and international leaders. These living-and-learning experiences between classroom and community, perhaps even more than those in a formal classroom, will define your experience at Yale-NUS.
