e0e CQT Research 20b7 HOME PEOPLE RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS EVENTS JOIN US A number of different research groups work within CQT. They cover topics ranging from the very theoretical (QIP=PSPACE) to the very practical (hacking quantum cryptography). In between, there are projects looking into the foundations of physics (Leggett inequalities), at exotic states of matter (Bose-Einstein condensates), geometric phases, the shadow cast by a single atom, the relationships between entanglement and thermodynamics, and more. Explore the research happening at CQT in more detail by visiting our group and topic pages.
