ï»¿ NUS Double Degree in BBA and CNM: Overview NUS Home | Search: in NUS Websites Internet Staff Directory Advanced Search Home > Overview   Overview The Double Degree in Business and CNM is offered jointly by the NUS Business School and the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. In todayâ€™s global environment, the line separating communications & media studies and business is blurring, and often graduates from communications and media programs are expected to perform tasks that entail business trainingâ€”e.g. market analysis, marketing campaignsâ€”while business graduates are expected to know how to effectively communicate with a companyâ€™s publics, manage a crisis or chart out technology trends. Likewise, in todayâ€™s converging media environment, communication professionals are expected to have a broad range of knowledge and creative skillsâ€”from critical thinking and excellent writing to the ability to create publications, websites and other interactive environments. Combined with modules in new media and communication management, CNMâ€™s modules in visual and game design seek to enrich studentâ€™s experience and prepare them for this converging field. NUSâ€™ Business programme prepares students for managerial leadership in the global economy. Its broad-based curriculum benefits from the comprehensive academic breadth and intellectual intensity of our national university. Articulate students that embrace technology will find good fit in this CNM and Business double degree programme that promises to nurture an attractive breed of media-savvy business professionals.
