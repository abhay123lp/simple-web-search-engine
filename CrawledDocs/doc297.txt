The DET is an English Language test set by the Centre for English Language Communication. It must be taken by all international graduate students from non-English medium universities whose faculties require them to take it. The purposes of the DET are to: determine which students will benefit from the Basic Level Writing module (ES5000) before proceeding to the Intermediate Level Writing module (ES5001A), determine which students will benefit from the Intermediate Level Writing module (ES5001A) before taking the Advanced Level Writing (ES5002) module to help them with their thesis writing and identify which students may be exempted from taking either of the above-mentioned modules.
