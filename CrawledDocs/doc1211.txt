By recognizing the unique structural and functional motifs, and uncovering novel reactivities embedded within the molecular assembly, Dr Chen’s team strategically devised and successfully executed the syntheses of several complex molecular constructs featuring the state-of-the-art atomic bond forming processes with exquisite chemo-, regio- and stereo-control. In parallel, Dr Chen’s ongoing pursuit in understanding molecular interactions with biological targets has resulted in several chemical agents with promising antibiotic and anticancer properties, and provided the foundation for structural-activity-relationship (SAR) studies. Since the establishment of the Chemical Synthesis Laboratory (CSL) @ Biopolis in August 2005, Dr Chen’s team has contributed to the studies of thiopeptide antibiotics exhibiting selective inhibitory action by interacting with elongation factor EF?Tu involved in the bacterial protein synthesis pathway, identified several highly potent V-ATPase inhibitors selectively targeting malignant melanoma, developed broad-spectrum antibiotics inhibiting the highly-conserved bacterial fatty-acid synthase (FabF/H), and discovered an unprecedented anti-angiogenic agent displaying extraordinarily potent and selective anti-proliferative properties. Dr Chen’s research articles are visible and highlighted in several world-class scientific journals, and gained international recognition with more than 450 total citations. Dr Chen has presented in numerous invited lectures in reputable scientific meetings, and mentored more than 50 postdoctoral researchers and students over the past three years as the Principal Investigator of the Chemical Synthesis Laboratory (CSL) @ Biopolis. For his outstanding work on synthetic chemistry and chemical biology, and application to the discovery and development of novel therapeutics, Dr David Chen is awarded the 2008 Young Scientist Award.   Related Information Our Research Community Honours & Accolades Scholars' Achievements   Resources News Visits Publications Photo and Video Gallery Quick Links --Select-- A*STAR Research Research Institutes Singapore Researchers Database A*STAR Resource Portal A*STAR Cloud Terms & Conditions  |  Privacy Statement |  Sitemap  | Rate Us Copyright 2009 Agency for Science, Technology and Research
