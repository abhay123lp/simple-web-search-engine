The University seeks to inculcate students with the above qualities through both formal and informal education that extends from the classroom environment to a larger institutional culture outside the classroom.  The latter includes the myriad learning opportunities in residential living. NUS recognizes its distinctive educational role as a university with both an Asian and international identity. This unique position creates the possibility of equally unique perspectives, and allows the University to retain a global outlook while drawing from and reflecting upon the character and resources of the region.   Academic Governance The Senate is the highest academic body of the University. Chaired by the President of the University, the Senate meets regularly to deliberate on educational policy and other academic issues. The following Senate committees, chaired by the Vice Provost (Education), or nominee, with representatives from among Senate members and the various Deaneries, examine and make recommendations to Senate on educational issues: University Committee on Educational Policy (UCEP) Board of Undergraduate Studies (BUS) Board of Graduate Studies (BGS) Among the duties of these committees are to review, evaluate and recommend changes to: the general curriculum structure; existing and new degree programmes; other educational policy issues, such as advance placement credits and general education.   The minimum requirements for undergraduate and graduate students set by the University are specified in the NUS Bulletin.  Individual Faculties / Departments / Programmes may set additional requirements for their degree programmes according to the demands of the discipline.         © Copyright 2001-2011 National University of Singapore.
