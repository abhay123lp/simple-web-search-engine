Low rate credit cards are best for people that donâ€™t pay off their credit card balance every month. The more debt you have, the higher the importance of having the lowest interest rate on your balance. Swapping to a low rate card can save a great deal in interest payments. See all low rate cards Balance Transfer Credit Cards Balance transfer credit cards are great for people that currently suffer high credit card debt. You can transfer the balance of your previous credit card(s) to a new provider. The new provider rewards you by charging none to very little interest for a period of time. See all balance trans1000fer cards Rewards Credit Cards Rewards credit cards generally charge a high level of interest. The annual fee is much higher than other types. They are best used by people that pay off their balance every month plus have a reasonably high spend on their card. When thinking about reward cards you should forecast how much you think you will spend in a year. Check how many points you will receive and what you can get for those points. This is a great way to compare reward cards as 1 point in one program can be totally different to 1 point in another. If the rewards outstrip the higher costs then this type of card is for you. See all rewards cards Frequent Flyer Credit Cards These are a type of rewards credit card whereby the main rewards are points that can be used for free tickets or upgrades on flights. Frequent flyer cards are best used by people that travel regularly and have a decent credit card spent every month. They typically attract the highest level of interest, therefore are best for people that pay off their balance each month. See all frequent flyer cards No Annual Fee Credit Cards No annual free credit cards typically have a higher level of standard interest than other cards, and are best used by people that pay off their balance every month. No annual fee offers generally donâ€™t offer any rewards program. They can be great to have as a second card for emergency access to funds. You get the ability to access funds if you need to without the annual fee. See all no annual fee cards Debit Cards Debit cards are issued through Visa or MasterCard meaning that they can be used anywhere that the respective credit cards are accepted. Instead of being charged interest you load your own money onto the cards and then use them as you would a credit card. They can be very convenient when travelling to replace carrying cash around. Additionally you donâ€™t have to be over 18 to apply.
