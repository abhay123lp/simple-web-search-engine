But few know the back story to what it takes to write one that matters. STâ€™s senior correspondent Radha Basu, this yearâ€™s winner of a major Singapore Press Holdings journalism award for Feature of the Year, offers an insight into the energy and resources required to write a winning story. The award she won is part of SPH's English and Malay Newspapers Division's annual event in recognising newsroom excellence. Ms Basu is also a two-time winner for feature writing and human rights journalism respectively given by The Society of Publishers in Asia. She is as well the recipient of the Aware Heroine award from the Association of Women for Action and Research for promoting gender equality. - Readers' ed By RADHA BASU, Senior correspondent IN LATE April last year, a Straits Times Forum page contribution by reader Lim Fah Kiong, 68, caught my eye. His wife had dementia and he exhorted readers to seek treatment early if a loved one showed symptoms of the debilitating disease. While the letter was penned in a measured, matter-of-fact tone, the last line left me concerned: Could the Ministry of Health get volunteer social workers to assist â€œlone caregiversâ€? in distress, suggested Mr Lim, who is childless. Was he speaking from experience, I wondered. At the time, I was considering a feature on the needs and concerns of Singaporeâ€™s growing army of caregivers. I gave Mr Lim a call... CAPTION: Balancing work and family is hard but works in large part owing to a supportive husband at home and an understanding boss at work, says winning ST writer Radha Basu seen here with her daughters Rhea, 16, and Maya, 7.

Sadly, The Straits Times virtually appears to be encouraging this. As a public relations practitioner, I am always mindful and constantly reminding my clients that ST will not promote or endorseÂ individuals or products in their editorials. How do I then justify the exception made by this article (Ex-finance manager goes into fashion business, Jan 15)? Why provide free advertising and publicity for a suspect in a corruption case. Is the article newsworthy?Â  RELATED LINKS City Harvest trial: Defence grills auditor about what she knew Ex-finance manager Serina Wee goes into fashion business Â  Â  Read more Cat Island: Good or bad publicity? DARREN CHAN KENG LEONG THE Sunday Times article (Cat Island that needs to lose that lovinâ€™ feline,Â Jan 19) piqued my interest. By covering the story, would there be negative consequences for the cats that live on the island? The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) is spearheading the project and has been there about a dozen times.Â By publicising the place, owners of cats may choose to conveniently abandon their unwanted cats on the island. This will lead to an additional increase in population of the strays living on the island.Â Another fear is that breeders may exploit unsterilised cats on the island to breed kittens for sale to Singaporeans. Â This will create a health hazard for the cats and increase the number of abandoned pets. The publicity will hamper SPCAâ€™s efforts in sterilising the number of cats and as there is the lack of CCTVs to monitor the situation.Â Preventive measures are not in place to stop anyone from abandoning their pet there.Â As the island is easily accessible, providing specific details may encourage the attitude of using the island as a dumping ground for unwanted cats.Â  Â  Read more Snapshots Assault on Hong Kong Media Executives Adds to Press Freedom Concerns By AUSTIN RAMZY An assault on two executives of a Hong Kong newspaper by men with iron bars has heightened concerns about press freedom and the safety of journalists in the semiautonomous Chinese city.
