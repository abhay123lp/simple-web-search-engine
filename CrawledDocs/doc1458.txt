OK, a few dozen apps. Or a few hundred, whatever. So, what, that makes you some kind of genius?</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">OK, great, so you can stream content from YouTube and Netflix and Hulu. Are they giving a Nobel Prize for that now? You think you're all that and a board of chips just because you can play video from an attached USB device, or music from a networked PC, or photos from your smart phone.&nbsp;What good did that ever do anyone, besides give them hours of pleasure?</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">All I know is, I'm sick of you self-professed smart TVs strutting around with your fancy features and your fancy Clear Motion Rate picture quality and your fancy Eco light sensor. You think you're better than me, huh? Well, tell me this, smart guy: are you smart enough to teach any random idiot how to be smart like you? Like, say, me? Huh? Are you?

Today it's exactly the same... except for the part where the phone isn't on the wall. It's on your wrist. Your <strong>wrist.</strong></p><p>It's hard to imagine what a game changer this is. Possibly because... it's not. No, seriously. People have been planning for this day since like<em> forever</em>. A way to get phone calls and texts on your wrists isn't <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Et7CoplfKw" target="_blank">anything that's in any way new.</a></p><p>But it is neat. And useful. And it's kinda fun to lift your watch up to your mouth and make a phone call, or send a text, or check the weather. We're not gonna lie to you, this is the kind of thing we would have been saving up to buy once upon a time.</p><p>Just don't act like it's something them 21st Century Kids invented all by themselves, okay?

(Actually, the queen celebrates her official public birthday in June, because the weather is likely to be nicer then. That is a true fact. But she was actually born in April.) In honor of Her Majesty, weâ€™ve asked</i> Jeopardy!<i> smart-arse Ken Jennings to spend the month debunking misinformation about the monarchy. Apparently weâ€™ve been royally misled for years.</i></p><p><strong>The Debunker: Do Londoners Check the Time on Big Ben?</strong></p><p>When I got married back in 2000, we spent our honeymoon in London. A friend of my wifeâ€™s asked her, â€œWhat are you guys going to do all day, besides look at Old Ben?â€? I was a little aggrieved at this description of my anatomy, until I realized she had meant to refer to â€œBig Ben,â€? which as everyone knows is the clock tower at the north end of the Houses of Parliament, right? Wrong. Yes, the clock tower is an iconic symbol of London. But no, itâ€™s not called Big Ben.</p><img alt="donnnnnnng" src="http://d3gqasl9vmjfd8.cloudfront.net/06236541-7e53-481c-b2cc-015139d1a3a0.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-bottom:10px;" width="250" /><p>The only way to use Big Ben to check the time is to wait for it to strikeâ€”which it does every hour. Big Ben is actually the 13-ton bell that sits inside the clock tower. (A series of smaller bells plays the quarter-hour chimes, the famous Westminster Quarters.) The origin of the Big Ben nickname is uncertain: it may refer to Sir Benjamin Hall, the engineer who led the rebuilding of Parliament in the 1850s, or to â€œBig Benâ€? Caunt, a popular heavyweight boxing champ of the time.</p><p>So if Big Ben is the bell, whatâ€™s the famous tower called? For many years, the official name of the clock tower wasâ€”wait for it!â€”â€œClock Tower.â€? Nice. In 2012, however, Queen Elizabeth II celebrated her Diamond Jubilee, marking sixty years on the British throne. In her honor, Parliament voted to rename the tower-not-formerly-known-as-Big-Ben as the Elizabeth Tower. After all, Westminsterâ€™s other spire, the one at the southwest corner, is known as the Victoria Tower. At this point, pretty much the whole building is named for a couple of old queens.</p><p><b>Quick Quiz</b>: In what 1985 movie does a driver get trapped circling a Westminster roundabout for hours, repeatedly saying, â€œLook, kids!

Out of our <strike>desperate attempt to be rich</strike> love for giving you options, we've added a little something extra for today. Come on in and check it out!</strong></p><p>If there's one thing we've learned in nine-plus years of hustling discount widgets, it's that "good or bad?" is the wrong question to ask about a product. The question is, is the price right? A gizmo that stinks like feces at $100 might shine like gold at $20.</p><p>So we're hoping our latest price drop puts the shine on this HP 17.3" Touchsmart laptop. Aside from the irrational fear and loathing that Windows 8 inspires in the hearts of men, it can do a lot for a laptop at this price. That 1920x1080 touchscreen, 8GB DDR3 memory, the 1TB hard drive, four USB ports including one USB 3.0: these are burly specs. This laptop totally shreds, people! Come on!</p><p>But the market's truths are pitiless and not subject to appeal. And the market says we've still got a pile of these laptops on our hands. So the experiment continues: what's the magic price that sends these flying off of our shelves and into your hands?</p>Mon, 07 Apr 2014 15:27:15 Z2014-04-07T15:27:15Zurn:uuid:d01def10-f2ca-49df-bf94-5b6b98f4fc63 http://www.woot.com/blog/post/music-monday-conspiracy-songsmusicmusic-mondaycover-story Music Monday: Conspiracy Songs<div align="center"><img src="http://d3gqasl9vmjfd8.cloudfront.net/d8d86304-2580-4b0b-a859-9c3d791188fc.png" /></div><p><i>Happy Music Monday!
