Myanmar was one of them. The inaugural STEER Myanmar trip from 26 December 2013 to 9 January 2014 brought 20 students from the University Scholars Programme (USP) to four cities in Myanmar, where they learnt more about its recent political and economic reforms and how these developments have impacted tourism in the country. As part of the STEER Myanmar programme, the NUS delegation visited the Universities of Yangon and Mandalay. They were the first foreign student group to be received by both universities since they re-opened undergraduate enrolment in December 2013 after decades of forced closure. At the University of Yangon, the delegation took part in a seminar on the archaeological heritage of Myanmar and interacted with students from the Archaeology and History departments. â€œThe freshmen were really friendly and proud of their university. Though it was just the end of their first week as Yangon undergraduates, they eagerly introduced the university to us. I appreciated the friendship and historical feel of the campusâ€?, said Mark Heng, a Year 3 Geography student, after the campus visit. In the capital city of Naypyitaw, a forum was exclusively organised for the students by the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development. This forum saw over 20 government officials from 12 Ministries engaging in discussions with the NUS students on Myanmarâ€™s reforms. Presentations were also given by the Foreign Economic Relations Department, Ministry of Commerce and Directorate of Investments and Companies Administration, to help students understand the rapid progress of Myanmarâ€™s economy and future plans for its growth. Commenting on the forum, Year 2 Science student Yan Shi said that it gave him a better understanding of the complexity of Myanmar's political and economic reforms and the diversity of Myanmar society. â€œWe have observed so many stakeholders with different, sometimes conflicting, interests, playing various roles in the country's development. These are the lessons that I can never fully learn within the four walls of the classroom,â€? he said. Additionally, this trip brought students up close and personal with prominent figures in diverse fields, including Daw Nanda Hmun (Director General, Department of Historical Research, Ministry of Culture), Mr William Chik (Deputy Chief of Mission, Singapore Embassy in Yangon), Dr Thant Thaw Kaung (CEO, Myanmar Book Centre), U Zaw Weik (Chairman, Bagan Hotel Association), Dr Myo Than Tyn (Ceramics specialist and historian) and U Sein Myint (an accomplished Myanmar artist). A guided walking tour of the city by local NGO Yangon Heritage Trust helped participants appreciate the history and architecture of Yangonâ€™s built landscape. Also weaved into the programme were cultural visits to famous sites and studies of local economies in Yangon, Mandalay, Bagan and Naypyitaw. From bright and colourful temple festivals to sunsets across the magnificent Bagan plain, the participants immersed themselves in the cultureÂ as well as the sights and sounds in the everyday lives of the Myanmar people. â€œMyanmar is not like what you have read in the textbooks or in the media. I am thankful to STEER for the chance to experience the real Myanmar!â€?, said Wesley Neoh-Khoo, a Year 1 Electrical Engineering student. Launched in 2010, STEER is designed for NUS students to gain exposure to the diverse social, cultural, economic, political and business environments of fast developing regions. The programme has seen study trips to the Middle East, Vietnam, India, China and Latin America.
