Towards this, MOUs (Memorandum of Understanding) have been signed with various organizations. These documents allow for cross-talk and active collaboration between MBI and partner institutions. Joint International Lab with CNRS France: LIA Cell Adhesion France Singapore In Nov 2011 MBI and CNRS signed a collaborative research agreement to study cell adhesion in various contexts. This agreement allows researchers and students to obtain traveling funds on collaborative projects and involves teams at MBI, ESPCI (Paris), University Paris 7 and University Bordeaux I. Current projects involve cell tractionÂ measurement, cell-cell junction formation dynamics, microwell technology and high end imaging. The Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) is the largest french organization forÂ  research with a strong emphasis on fundamental knowledge.   MOU with IISER (Indian Institute of Science Education and Research), Pune, INDIA This MOU, signed on the 27th of September, 2010, between MBI and IISER, Pune allows for exchange of scientific, academic, technical and other information of mutual interest. It also helps identify new avenues for cooperation and joint research and development in disciplines of mutual interest. Exchange of undergraduate and graduate students to undertake joint project study and exchange of faculty and/ or staff, organization of and participation in joint academic and scientific activities such as seminars and academic meetings are also parts of this MOU. IISER, Pune is one of the five premier teaching and research institutions established by the Government of India. The IISERs represent a unique initiative in India where teaching and education are totally integrated with state-of-the-art research nurturing both curiosity and creativity in an intellectually vibrant atmosphere of research.

MOU with NCBS (National Centre for Biological Sciences), Bangalore, INDIA The MOU between MBI and NCBS, signed on 5th November, 2010 is an understanding to promote scientific collaboration between the two institutes. This includes exchange of scientific, academic, technical information and academic material of mutual interest and identification of opportunities forÂ  cooperation. Exchange of undergraduate and graduate students to undertake joint project study and exchange of faculty and/ or staff, organization of and participation in joint academic and scientific activities such as seminars and academic meetings are also parts of this MOU. NCBS is a premier research institute in India, where the research interests of the faculty lie in the frontier area of biology. With the basic tenet that success in research requires research problems to be approached from a variety of directions, NCBS has researchers with a variety of backgrounds in natural sciences, mathematics and computer science tackling biological problems, through active collaborations at every level- within the country and internationally.
