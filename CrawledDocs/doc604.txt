The Diploma must be acceptable for the course(s) applied for. Applicants should also submit your Singapore-Cambridge GCE 'O' Level results, if available. If you are a student in your final semester of study at the Polytechnic, you can apply with your results obtained from your first 5 semesters of study. If you meet the admissions criteria, you will receive a provisional offer. You will then be requested to submit your final semester results. The admissions exercise for applicants presenting Diploma qualifications from a Polytechnic in Singapore opens from 1 to 21 February every year. Since 2009, NUS has published the A-level and polytechnic Indicative Grade Profiles and course places of the previous academic year (AY) to enable applicants to make more informed choices when applying for admission.
