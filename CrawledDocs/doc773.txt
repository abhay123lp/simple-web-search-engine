April 9, 2014 – IBN has won the A*STAR Outstanding Publications Award for the fifth time. This award recognizes the A*STAR research institute with the most quality publications per research staff in high impact journals last year. IBN is recognized as the most prolific A*STAR biomedical research institute in 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014. “We are delighted to win the A*STAR Outstanding Publications Award for the fifth time. IBN is a research institute that strives towards interdisciplinary collaborations and research excellence. This award is the result of the outstanding efforts put in by our staff and graduate students last year. We will continue to work hard so that we can make significant impact on healthcare and our society through the translation and commercialization of our research platforms,” said IBN Executive Director Professor Jackie Y. Ying. Since the Institute was founded in March 2003, it has published over 950 publications in peer-reviewed journals. In 2013, IBN scientists published 100 articles in archival journals, of which 57 were in journals of impact factor greater than 5, 16 were in journals of impact factor greater than 8, and 3 were in journals with impact factor greater than 15. The A*STAR Outstanding Publications Award was introduced in 2009 to recognize and celebrate the achievements of the A*STAR research institutes. Making Clothes from Sugar IBN researchers have found a green and efficient method to produce nylon from sugar The IBN research team, who invented the new green chemistry method to turn sugar into adipic acid (from left) Dr Ting Lu, Dr Yugen Zhang, Dr Xiukai Li and Dr Guangshun Yi. March 31, 2014 – In the future, the clothes you wear could be made from sugar. Researchers at the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (IBN) have discovered a new chemical process that can convert adipic acid directly from sugar. Adipic acid is an important chemical used to produce nylon for apparel and other everyday products like carpets, ropes and toothbrush bristles. Commercially, adipic acid is produced from petroleum-based chemicals through the nitric acid oxidation process, which emits large amounts of nitrous oxides, a major greenhouse gas that causes global warming. IBN Executive Director Professor Jackie Y. Ying said, “In the face of growing environmental concerns over the use of fossil fuels and diminishing natural resources, there is an increasing need for a renewable source for energy and chemicals. We have designed a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution to convert sugar into adipic acid via our patented catalytic process technology.” Read more. IBN Executive Director Professor Jackie Y. Ying in Singapore Women’s Hall of Fame IBN Executive Director Prof Jackie Y. Ying received the Singapore Women’s Hall of Fame Trophy from Ambassador-at-Large Prof Tommy Koh at the inaugural induction ceremony. March 21, 2014 – IBN Executive Director Professor Jackie Y. Ying has been inducted to the Singapore Women’s Hall of Fame, which recognizes and honors outstanding women of Singapore. Launched by the Singapore Council of Women’s Organizations, the induction ceremony was held on March 14, 2014 at the Shangri-La Hotel, and graced by President Tony Tan and his wife, Mrs Mary Tan. “I’m delighted and honored to be selected as one of the inaugural inductees to the Singapore Women’s Hall of Fame. I came back to Singapore 11 years ago to set up the world’s first bioengineering and nanotechnology research institute. At that time, Singapore was transitioning into a knowledge-based economy and the Biopolis was still under construction. A lot has transformed since then. Biopolis has developed into a world-class biomedical research hub and made numerous groundbreaking discoveries. I am proud to be a part of this exciting enterprise,” shared Prof Jackie Y. Ying. This year, 108 outstanding women were elected into the inaugural Singapore Women’s Hall of Fame (SWHF), and their achievements and contributions span 13 fields of endeavor over two centuries. The honorees were selected from a shortlist of some 200 candidates identified by a team of researchers and the SWHF working committee. The selection panel was headed by Ambassador-at-Large Professor Tommy Koh.
