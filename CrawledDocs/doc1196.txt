Recently featured in The Straits Times article â€˜Studentsâ€™ passions come aliveâ€™ (Feb 02, 2014) were several of our student groups, including the G-Spot and the gregarious Improv Club. These groups present only a taster of the myriad of student organisations that are continuing to form and develop, ranging from Dance, Theatre and Arts groups, to Debate and Model-UN, Sports and Athletics and even a Yale-NUS Investment Club. One of the most exciting aspects of joining the new class of Yale-NUS students is the unique opportunity to continue to help create these burgeoning student organizations. The opportunities for growth and showcase are limitless. There are also amazing opportunities to participate in extra-curricular activities through NUS, UTown, and in the broader community. NUS is one of the top universities in the world, with over a century of history, cutting-edge research, and a student body of 35,000. There are over 100 different student societies and interest groups at NUS. There is also a full spectrum of formal and informal support for you as current and incoming students. Informally, all of the Deanâ€™s Fellows served in many leadership roles across their undergraduate years â€“ Japanese drumming, slam poetry, rugby, a cappella, inter-faith dialogue, tutoring underprivileged children, to name just a few. As new Deanâ€™s Fellows come on board in the coming Academic year for the new incoming class, this pool of experience will continue to grow. Our amazing Faculty and Staff have also shown interest in mentoring and providing their own set of experiences and expertise. The Dean of Studentâ€™s Office and its energetic staff are also immensely happy to provide support to the emerging student groups. This team of staff is dedicated to building student and residential life, so the possibilities and energy for student activities and organizations will only continue to grow with the college.
