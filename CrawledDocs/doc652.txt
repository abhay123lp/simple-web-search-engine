The other research facility is on St Johnâ€™s Island, a 20-minute ferry ride away from the mainland.Â  Both locations have fully-equipped state-of-the-art laboratories to allow researchers to carry out R&D projects in the most conducive environment; be it in the marine or physical sciences.Â  Â  St Johnâ€™s Island Marine Laboratory Â  Location The marine laboratory is situated on St Johnâ€™s island (103.85Â°E, 1.22Â°N), which is located off the southern coast of Singapore mainland, in the Singapore Straits. The northern coastlines of the island consist of man-made lagoons. In contrast, the southern shoreline is relatively steep, with natural rocky shores and coral reefs. There are two small patches of mangroves, comprising Gymnorhiza, Sonneratia and nipah palm.Â  The surrounding habitats have unique biodiversity and offer many opportunities for research in Southeast Asian marine life Facilities There are two main research blocks, housing well-equipped laboratories to support a diverse range of marine biology and aquaculture research. Core facilities include algal culture facilities, research laboratories equipped with research stereomicroscopes and high-end photo-microscopy systems, field equipment for environmental surveys, larval culture facilities, histology, flow cytometry facility and laboratory for biological water quality analyses, facilities for molecular studies and state-of-the-art aquaculture laboratories. The main administrative building has a small library, meeting rooms, a seminar room, senior scientist offices and a general office equipped with photocopiers, a computer cluster and facsimile. The adjacent dormitory block has a laundry room, and air-conditioned bedrooms to accommodate up to 20 persons. There is no canteen but a well equipped kitchen with gas-stove, refrigerator and microwave oven is provided. Simple catered meals for visiting groups may be arranged through the admin office. Aquarium system Aquaria are supplied with flow-through raw, unfiltered seawater and high-throughput 20um filtered seawater, with option for recirculating filtration. There are two indoor aquaria with tank capacities up to 1000L. In addition, the outdoor area has large aquaculture tanks, with capacity up to 5000L. Wet labs in the main research blocks are also outfitted with seawater tables. Getting There TMSI has daily boat transfers for researchers using the marine laboratory. The journey from Pasir Panjang Ferry Terminal takes approximately 15-20 minutes. The Sentosa public ferry also services St Johnâ€™s island and the southern islands. Private boat hire is also available from Clifford Pier. Â  Â  Â  Webmaster Login Â© Copyright 2001-2009 National University of Singapore. All Rights Reserved.
