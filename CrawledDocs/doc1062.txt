Live in a Safe, Exciting and Multicultural City with 365 Days of â€˜Summerâ€™ Practice what you learned in your Chinese language course earlier that day with the aunties and uncles (terms of endearment and respect for those older than you in â€œSinglishâ€?) over kopi and kaya toast at the neighborhood coffee shop, explore Singapore's bustling nightlife, catch a 3am meal of Indian, Chinese, and Malay (and many more!) cuisines at one of the legendary food centres, or do all three in the same day!Â  Singapore is located one degree north of the equator which makes for a hot and sunny climate year-round, meaning youâ€™ll never be stuck indoors and you can get a tan by the pool even in January.Â  Singapore is your Gateway to Southeast Asia! From Singapore, most regional destinations are only a few hoursâ€™ flight away. Within 4 hours of flying you can reach China, India, Australia or the Philippines, and in even less time you can reach the countries right at Singaporeâ€™s doorstep â€“ Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and Indonesia!Â  Even more importantly, you can travel to them easily and as cheaply or luxuriously as you want.Â  In fact, just taking the ferry to the many beautiful islands of Malaysia and Indonesia can make the perfect weekend trip. During their semester or year at NUS many adventurous students travel to the ruins of Angkor Wat, to see the beauty of Ha Long Bay and to party under the full moon at Koh Phangan in Thailand. From Singapore, Asia is yours to discover. © Copyright 2001- National University of Singapore. All Rights Reserved.
