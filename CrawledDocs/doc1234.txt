We report here the presence of R-loops in the testes from other autosomal recessive ataxia mouse models, which correlate with fertility in these disorders. R-loops were coincident in cells showing high basal levels of DNA double strand breaks and in those cells undergoing apoptosis. Depletion of Setx led to high basal levels of R-loops and these were enhanced further by DNA damage both in vitro and in vivo in tissues with proliferating cells. There was no evidence for accumulation of R-loops in the brains of mice where Setx, Atm, Tdp1 or Aptx genes were disrupted. These data provide further evidence for genome destabilization as a consequence of disrupted transcription in the presence of DNA double strand breaks arising during DNA replication or recombination. They also suggest that R-loop accumulation does not contribute to the neurodegenerative phenotype in these autosomal recessive ataxias. type:  Journal Paper journal:  PLOS One, March 2014, Vol. 9, Issue 3, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0090219 pubmed:  24637776 Url:  http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0090219 Impact Factor:  3.73 Date of acceptance:  2014-01-27 Authors:  YEO Abrey BECHEREL Olivier LUFF John CULLEN Jason WONGSURAWAT Thidathip JENJAROENPUN Piroon KUZNETSOV Vladimir MCKINNON Peter LAVIN Martin Research Group:  Computational Analysis of Genome Complexity Genome and Gene Expression Data Analysis
