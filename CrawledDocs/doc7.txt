Scientific method Science is formed from methodical study of nature stemming from testable explanations and predictions. An older and closely related current meaning emerged from Aristotle, whereby "science" referred to the body of reliable knowledge that is logically and rationally explained (see "History and etymology" section below). Since classical antiquity, science as knowledge was closely linked to philosophy. In the early modern era the two words, "science" and "philosophy", were sometimes used interchangeably in the English language. By the 17th century, "natural philosophy" emerged as "natural science", separate from "philosophy", in general. "Science" continued to denote reliable knowledge about a topic; it remains in use in modern terms such as library science or political science. Ever-evolving, "science" is, more modernly, a term referring to the pursuit of knowledge, and not the knowledge itself. It is often synonymous with â€˜natural and physical scienceâ€™, and often restricted to those branches of study relating to the phenomena of the material universe and their law(s). Sometimes the term implies 497eexclusion of pure mathematics although many university faculties include Mathematics Departments within their Faculty of Science. The dominant sense in ordinary use has a narrower use for the term "science". It developed as a part of science becoming a distinct enterprise of defining "laws of nature"; early examples include Kepler's laws, Galileo's laws, and Newton's laws of motion. In this period it became more common to refer to natural philosophy as "natural science". Over the course of the 19th century, the word "science" became increasingly associated with the disciplined study of the natural world, including physics, chemistry, geology and biology. This sometimes left the study of human thought and society in a linguistic limbo, which was resolved by classifying these areas of academic study as social science. For example, Psychology evolved from Philosophy, and has grown as an area of study. Currently, there are both hard (e.g, biological psychology) and soft science (e.g., social psychology) fields within the discipline. As a result, and as is consistent with the unfolding of the study of knowledge and development of methods to establish facts, each area of psychology employs a scientific method. Reflecting the evolution of the development of knowledge and established facts, and use of the scientific method, Psychology Departments in universities are found in all of: Faculty of Arts and Science, Faculty of Arts, and within a Faculty of Science. Similarly, several other major areas of disciplined study and knowledge exist today under the general rubric of "science", such as formal science and applied science. More about Science...

Mission planners hope that NASA will approve plans to continue the mission with a fly-by of a Kuiper Belt Object and return further data. A consortium of organizations, led by Southwest Research Institute and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, has built the craft. The mission's principal investigator is S. Alan Stern of Southwest Research. The probe successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida at 14:00 EST January 19, 2006 and flew past Jupiter on February 28, 2007 for a gravity assist. The primary scientific objectives are to characterize the global geology and morphology and map the surface composition of Pluto and Charon, and study the neutral atmosphere of Pluto and its escape rate. Other objectives include studying time variability of Pluto's surface and atmosphere; imaging and mapping areas of Pluto and Charon at high-resolution; characterizing Pluto's upper atmosphere, ionosphere, and energetic particle environment; searching for an atmosphere around Charon; refining bulk parameters of Pluto and Charon; and searching for additional satellites and rings. ...Archive/Nominations Read more... edit   Selected picture Credit: Foobar Gallium (IPA: /ËˆgaliÉ™m/) is a chemical element that has the symbol Ga and atomic number 31. A rare, soft silvery metallic poor metal, gallium is a brittle solid at low temperatures but liquefies slightly above room temperature and will melt in the hand. It occurs in trace amounts in bauxite and zinc ores. An important application is in the compound gallium arsenide, used as a semiconductor, most notably in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). ...Archive/Nominations Read more... edit   Selected biography Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 â€“ September 2, 1992) was a pioneering American scientist and one of the world's most distinguished cytogeneticists. McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927, where she was a leader in the development of maize cytogenetics. The field remained the focus of her research for the rest of her career. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique to visualize maize chromosomes and demonstrate genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosisâ€”a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, and she demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere. She was awarded prestigious fellowships and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944. ...Archive/Nominations Read more... edit   Did you know... ...that space artist Jon Lomberg (artwork pictured) was Carl Sagan's principal artistic collaborator on many projects such as Cosmos and the Voyager Golden Record? ...that NASA astronaut Stephen Robinson has logged 497 hours in space? ...that Othniel Charles Marsh named two species of the dinosaur Coelurus from the same quarry, not knowing that the bones belonged to the same skeleton? ...that the type specimen of Dromicosuchus had damage to its jaw and neck that may have been inflicted by the teeth of the large carnivore it was found underneath? ...that the scientific name of the common Australian garden fungus AseroÃ« rubra means 'red disgusting juice'? ...Archive/Nominations Read more... edit   Associated Wikimedia Science portal on Wikinews     Science on Wikiquote     Science subject on Wikibooks     Science portal on Wikisource     Science category on Wikicommons     Science category on Wiktionary     Wikiversity School of Science News Quotations Manuals Texts Images Definitions Learning Wikipedia's Portals All Portals Overview Glossaries Indexes Lists Outlines Categories Reference Culture Geography Health History Mathematics Nature People Philosophy Religion Society Technology Featured portals About portals Purge server cache Retrieved from "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Portal:Science&oldid=602816478" Categories: Science portal Science Science portals WikiProject Science Hidden categories: Wikipedia move-protected portals Featured portals Navigation menu Personal tools Create account Log in Namespaces Portal Talk Variants Views Read Edit View history Actions Search Navigation Main page Contents Featured content Current events Random article Donate to Wikipedia Wikimedia Shop Interaction Help About Wikipedia Community portal Recent changes Contact page Tools What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Data item Print/export Create a book Download as PDF Printable version Languages Alemannisch Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø±Ø¨ÙŠØ© à¦¬à¦¾à¦‚à¦²à¦¾ Ð‘ÑŠÐ»Ð³Ð°Ñ€Ñ?ÐºÐ¸ Boarisch CatalÃ  Cebuano Deutsch Î•Î»Î»Î·Î½Î¹ÎºÎ¬ EspaÃ±ol Ù?Ø§Ø±Ø³ÛŒ FranÃ§ais Frysk í•œêµ­ì–´ à¤¹à¤¿à¤¨à¥?à¤¦à¥€ à¦¬à¦¿à¦·à§?à¦£à§?à¦ªà§?à¦°à¦¿à¦¯à¦¼à¦¾ à¦®à¦£à¦¿à¦ªà§?à¦°à§€ Bahasa Indonesia Interlingua Ã?slenska Italiano Kapampangan áƒ¥áƒ?áƒ áƒ—áƒ£áƒšáƒ˜ ÒšÐ°Ð·Ð°Ò›ÑˆÐ° Kiswahili LatvieÅ¡u Limburgs ÐœÐ°ÐºÐµÐ´Ð¾Ð½Ñ?ÐºÐ¸ Bahasa Melayu ÐœÐ¾Ð½Ð³Ð¾Ð» á€™á€¼á€”á€ºá€™á€¬á€˜á€¬á€žá€¬ à¤¨à¥‡à¤ªà¤¾à¤²à¥€ à¤¨à¥‡à¤ªà¤¾à¤² à¤­à¤¾à¤·à¤¾ æ—¥æœ¬èªž Ð?Ð¾Ñ…Ñ‡Ð¸Ð¹Ð½ Norsk bokmÃ¥l Norsk nynorsk Occitan à¬“à¬¡à¬¼à¬¿à¬† OÊ»zbekcha Ù¾Ù†Ø¬Ø§Ø¨ÛŒ Polski PortuguÃªs Ripoarisch RomÃ¢nÄƒ Runa Simi Ð ÑƒÑ?Ñ?ÐºÐ¸Ð¹ Seeltersk à·ƒà·’à¶‚à·„à¶½ SlovenÅ¡Ä?ina Soomaaliga Ú©ÙˆØ±Ø¯ÛŒ Suomi Svenska Tagalog à®¤à®®à®¿à®´à¯?
