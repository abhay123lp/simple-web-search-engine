The Microscopy Core is the largest of the MBI core facilities, serving as the backbone for most of the experimental work at the Institute. The Core supports image related research, offering a wide range of microscopes and image analysis resources. MBI’s Microscopy Core supports image-related research, offering a wide range of microscopes for use by Mechanobiology researchers and students. (Pictured left to right:) Liu Jun, Lau Wai Han, Goh Shu Hui, Felix Margadant, Wong Pei Yee, Mak Kah Jun, Chin Fei Li. As of 2010, MBI’s microscopy facility has the following instruments: Three confocals specified for different tasks: a PerkinElmer Spinning disk for very high speed confocal imaging at lowest light levels, a NikonA1Rsi equipped with a 32 channel spectral imaging head, the Zeiss Conforcor III for fluorescent correlation spectroscopy with ultra-low chromatic aberration lenses and the newest avalanche diode sensors offering triple the sensitivity of high end FCS system. MBI provides equipment, staff and services to support and overcome the experimental challenges that our PIs, researchersÂ  and students face. Three wide-field fluorescence multi-position live cell imaging systems for long term imaging: the DeltaVision Core which offers true 3D widefield imaging and automated time series of volume datasets on several specimen all in a full sized environmental chamber, the Olympus Live Cell imaging system with a cooled HQ+ CCD camera and a full size incubation chamber, HBO lines, and a motorized stage, and the Nikon BiostationIMQ which offers automated single specimen operation. Three TIRF based microscopes optimized for different purposes: the Olympus TIRF for multiwavelength TIRF, hosting two high end EMCCD camera systems and a motorized stabilized stage in a full size clear chamber for single photon counting and high resolution imaging at lowest light conditions useful for long time single molecule observation. The Zeiss Elyra Beta with high power solid state laser modules and an EMCCD camera system for super resolution imaging (PALM and STORM) in a full size enclosed chamber, and the Nikon TIRF with a compact EMCCD camera for magnet tweezer operation. One motorized stereomicroscope for the microfabrication Core, one AFM, and one magnetic piezo tweezer system. For image processing, we have Huygens for deconvolution, Imaris and Volocity for 3D visualization and data analysis, MetaMorph and ImageJ for data analysis, and three high end workstations sporting each 8 cores, 48GB, 4TB RAID0 disk systems, and fast graphics on 30â€? screens. Learn more The Microscopy Core currently has three full-time staff providing training and consultation to MBI and NUS researchers. Internal staff may learn more about the Core,Â  including calendaring and booking, a complete workshop schedule, user policy and safety, and equipment overview at the MBI Microscopy Core site.
