Financial aid will be offered to eligible applicants who have been assessed to be needy. This will be in the form of a financial aid package which is designed based on the recognition that an education in the University is a partnership involving the student, his/her family and the University. In structuring the package, an average student’s expected cost of attendance consisting tuition fees and living expenses, is taken into account. The financial aid package that is offered may comprise a combination of loans, bursary and work-study assistance, depending on the extent of the student’s level of neediness which is assessed based on the declared family income and mitigating factors, if any.
